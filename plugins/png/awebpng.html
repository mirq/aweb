   AWeb PNG plugin</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
The <em>awebpng</em> plugin for AWeb allows you to view all PNG images.
Features include:
<ul>
<li>Optional progressive display of loading images
<li>Support for transparent images
<li>Support for scaling
<li>Support for CyberGraphics
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Follow these steps to install the AWeb PNG plugin.
<ol>
<li>
Run the supplied Installer script. It will copy the necessary files to a
drawer <code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is
located.
<br><br>
<li>
<form action="x-aweb:rexx/AWebPath:AWebPlugin/Docs/awebpng.awebrx">
Run the <input type=submit value="Setup script">.
</form>
</ol>

<h2>Manual Installation</h2>
If, for some reason, you don't want to install the plugin automatically, you
can install it by hand.
<ol>
<li>
Copy the file named <code>awebpng.awebplugin</code> to a location of your
choice. The recommended location for plugins like this is a drawer
<code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is located.
<br><br>
<li>
Start AWeb, open the browser settings and bring up the <em>Viewers</em> page.
Select the entry for MIME type <code>IMAGE/PNG</code> and change the following
settings:
<ul>
   <li>Action: "AWeb Plugin (A)"
   <li>Name: the location where you copied the file <code>awebpng.awebplugin</code>
   <li>Arguments: leave blank or supply optional parameters, see below
</ul>
<br><br>
<li>
Don't forget to save your settings.
</ol>

<h2><a name=parameters>Parameters</a></h2>
The awebpng plugin supports two optional parameters. You can type the chosen
parameters in the "Arguments:" field of the settings window. Separate the
parameters by a comma or space, if you specify more than one.

<dl>
<dt><code><b>PROGRESS=</b>0|<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Specifies the number of image scan lines to decode before the display is
   updated. A higher number is faster but results in chunkier building of the
   image. PROGRESS=1 gives the smoothest progressive display but is relatively
   slow. The default value is 4, which is a good compromise between speed and
   visual attractiveness.
<p>
   If you specify PROGRESS=0, progressive display is disabled. The image is
   not displayed until decoding is ready.
<p>
<dt><code><b>MULTIPASS=</b>0|1</code>
<dd>Specifies if interlaced PNG images should be rendered progressively.
   MULTIPASS=1 (the default) will display interlaced PNGs in multiple passes,
   each with increasing quality.
   <p>
   Use MULTIPASS=0 to disable rendering in multiple passes, and only display
   the final image. This may be faster when reading from fast connections or
   from local files. This also disables PROGRESS (sets to 0) otherwise
   interlaced PNGs would still appear to decode in a multipass manner.
<p>

<dt><code><b>GAMMA=</b>number</code>
<dd>Specifies the gamma colour correction factor for your configuration. It is
   usually a number in the range 1.0 through 2.5. Default is 2.0.
<p>
<dt><code><b>LOWPRI</b></code>
<dd>The LOWPRI argument will run the decoder at a lower priority than default.
   If you are using your Amiga for other tasks while AWeb is downloading images,
   this feature helps you to keep the GUI responsive when many images are being
   decoded.
   However, if you are running CPU intensive tasks this argument could stop
   images from being processed alltogether.
<p>
   Note that the LOWPRI argument might not be effective when you use a custom task
   scheduler like Executive. Use task name "AWebPng decoder" to configure the
   decoder task in custom schedulers.
