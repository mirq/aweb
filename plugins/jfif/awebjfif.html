   AWeb JFIF plugin</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
The <em>awebjfif</em> plugin for AWeb allows you to view all JFIF images.
Features include:
<ul>
<li>Optional progressive display of loading images
<li>Support for scaling
<li>Support for CyberGraphics
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Follow these steps to install the AWeb JFIF plugin.
<ol>
<li>
Run the supplied Installer script. It will copy the necessary files to a
drawer <code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is
located.
<p>
The installer script might ask you for a location to store temporary swap
files during decoding of large images. You should select a drawer on your
hard disk.
<br><br>
<li>
<form action="x-aweb:rexx/AWebPath:AWebPlugin/Docs/awebjfif.awebrx">
Run the <input type=submit value="Setup script">.
</form>
</ol>

<h2>Manual Installation</h2>
If, for some reason, you don't want to install the plugin automatically, you
can install it by hand.
<ol>
<li>
Copy the file named <code>awebjfif.awebplugin</code> to a location of your
choice. The recommended location for plugins like this is a drawer
<code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is located.
<br><br>
<li>Select a drawer on your hard disk for the temporary swap files. These files
may be needed during decoding of large images. Add the following assign to
your <code>S:User-Startup</code> file if it isn't already there:
<dl><dd><code>assign JPEGTMP: <var>swap_drawer</var></code>
</dl>
where <var>swap_drawer</var> is the drawer you selected.
<br><br>
<li>
Start AWeb, open the browser settings and bring up the <em>Viewers</em> page.
Select the entry for MIME type <code>IMAGE/JPEG</code> and change the following
settings:
<ul>
   <li>Action: "AWeb Plugin (A)"
   <li>Name: the location where you copied the file <code>awebjfif.awebplugin</code>
   <li>Arguments: leave blank or supply optional parameters, see below
</ul>
<br><br>
<li>
Don't forget to save your settings.
</ol>
Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the MIME type <code>IMAGE/PJPEG</code>

<h2><a name=parameters>Parameters</a></h2>
The awebjfif plugin supports some optional parameters. You can type the chosen
parameters in the "Arguments:" field of the settings window. Separate the
parameters by a comma or space, if you specify more than one.

<dl>
<dt><code><b>PROGRESS=</b>0|<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Specifies the number of image scan lines to decode before the display is
   updated. A higher number is faster but results in chunkier building of the
   image. PROGRESS=1 gives the smoothest progressive display but is relatively
   slow. The default value is 4, which is a good compromise between speed and
   visual attractiveness.
<p>
   If you specify PROGRESS=0, progressive display is disabled. The image is
   not displayed until decoding is ready.
<p>
<dt><code><b>MULTIPASS=</b>0|1</code>
<dd>Specifies if progressive JPEG images should be rendered progressively.
   MULTIPASS=1 (the default) will display progressive JPEGs in multiple passes,
   each with increasing quality.
   <p>
   Use MULTIPASS=0 to disable rendering in multiple passes, and only display
   the final image. This may be faster when reading from fast connections or
   from local files.
<p>
<dt><code><b>DITHER=</b>0|1|2</code>
<dd>A number specifying the dither mode if colourmapped images are generated.
   This option takes only effect on screens with 256 colours or less. On
   CyberGraphics screens with more than 256 colours, true colour images are
   produced and no dithering is performed.
   <p>
   The number specifies the type of dithering as follows:
   <table>
   <tr><td><b>number</b><td><b>dither mode</b>
   <tr valign=top><td align=center>0<td>No dithering (fast but low quality)
   <tr valign=top><td align=center>1<td>Ordered (compromise between no dithering and Floyd-Steinberg)
   <tr valign=top><td align=center>2<td>Floyd-Steinberg (best quality but slow).
      This is the default.
   </table>
<p>
<dt><code><b>GRAYSCALE</b></code>
<dd>Produce grayscale images. This is faster than colour images.
<p>
<dt><code><b>MAXMEM=</b><var>number</var></code>
<dd>Specifies the maximum amount of scratch memory (in kB) to be used for the decoding
   process of each image. Large images may take quite a lot of memory during
   decoding. If an image needs more memory than the specified maximum, a virtual
   memory system is used. After the image has been decoded, the scratch memory
   is released, even if the image is still displayed.
   <p>
   Default for this parameter is 1024 (= 1 megabyte). Note that the maximum
   is used on a per-image basis, not for all images together.
<p>
<dt><code><b>LOWPRI</b></code>
<dd>The LOWPRI argument will run the decoder at a lower priority than default.
   If you are using your Amiga for other tasks while AWeb is downloading images,
   this feature helps you to keep the GUI responsive when many images are being
   decoded.
   However, if you are running CPU intensive tasks this argument could stop
   images from being processed alltogether.
<p>
   Note that the LOWPRI argument might not be effective when you use a custom task
   scheduler like Executive. Use task name "AWebJFIF decoder" to configure the
   decoder task in custom schedulers.
<dt><code><b>DEBUG=</b>0|1</code>
<dd>The DEBUG argument switches on or off output of errors and warnings from the
underlying JPEG Library to standard out.
<p>
DEBUG=0 no debug output (default)
<p>
DEBUG=1 output debug info.
</dl>
