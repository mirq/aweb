<h1>Plugin module internals</h1>

The diagram below shows the relevant section of AWebs internal structure.

For each file (document, image or other) that is referenced, either because
it is loaded into a frame or window, or because it appears as an embedded object in
an HTML document, a <b>SOURCE</b> object is created. No more than one SOURCE
object can exist for a given file.
<p>
For each time this file is referenced, a <b>COPY</b> object is created that
is related to the files SOURCE object. This COPY is also related to the
window or frame, either directly or from within the HTML document that is
shown in the window. The COPY object is responsible for displaying an
"unloaded" icon as long as the referenced file is not displayable yet.
<p>
When the file is actually retrieved, and data arrives for the file, <b>DRIVER</b>
objects are created. Various drivers are used for different MIME types,
and which type of driver objects are created depends on the MIME type of
the file, and on the users MIME settings.
<p>
The <b>SOURCEDRIVER</b> object receives blocks of data as AWeb receives them.
The SOURCEDRIVER should store this data in some way, and will probably
process it. When the data is processed so far that something can be displayed,
or the existing display can be updated, the SOURCEDRIVER signals the
<b>COPYDRIVER</b>. The COPYDRIVER in turn is responsible for actually displaying
the data, possibly scaled to a given width and height.
<p>
AWeb has a number of drivers built in, and these can be replaced or extended
by external drivers. This is where the <em>plugin module</em> comes into play:
a plugin module is merely an implementation of a SOURCEDRIVER class and a COPYDRIVER
class.
<p>
A plugin module is actually a <a href=plugin/index.html>shared library</a>
that is opened by the <b>SOURCE</b> object. The library must contain
dispatchers for both classes. Plugin modules have access to a
<a href=lib/index.html>support library</a> incorporated in the AWeb executable.
