<h1>AOTP_OBJECT class</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOTP_OBJECT</b> class is the root class of AWeb's object oriented hierarchy.

<h2>Supported methods</h2>

<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Method
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><th align=left valign=top><a href="../methods/dispose.html">AOM_DISPOSE</a>
   <td valign=top>Dispose the object
</table>

<h2>Supported attributes</h2>

The AOTP_OBJECT class does not support any attributes itself. It defines
a number of attributes that are used by many of the derived classes,
however.

<h2>Instance data structure</h2>

The AOTP_OBJECT class uses the following data structure:
<p>
<pre>
struct Aobject
{  APTR next;
   APTR prev;
   SHORT objecttype;
};
</pre>

Every object that is a direct subclass of AOTP_OBJECT <b>must</b> have this
structure as the first item in its instance data structure.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Field: <code>next, prev</code></h3>
These two fields effectively form a <code>MinNode</code> structure. You may
use these fields to link objects of your own classes in a list.
