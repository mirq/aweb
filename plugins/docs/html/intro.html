<h1>Introduction to AWeb plugin modules</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
A <b>plugin module</b> is a little program that handles a specific type
of data. The user can configure AWeb to use a certain plugin module for
certain MIME types. If a file of that MIME type is loaded, AWeb starts
the plugin module to process the data. The plugin module can render
directly in the AWeb browser window, or can open a separate window if
that is more appropriate. When the module renders in the AWeb window,
it can use the whole window or frame, or the object can be embedded
in HTML documents.
<p>
Examples of embedded objects are inlined images, but more generally
these objects are defined by the <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> tag.
<p>
Another type of plugin is a <b>filter</b>. A filter plugin reads
all data for a certain MIME type, and passes changed, textual data
back to AWeb. AWeb then processes and displayes this data internally.
<p>
Some plugin modules are distributed with AWeb, but since the interface
is public, third parties can write plugin modules too. This archive
contains full documentation needed to write AWeb plugin modules.
