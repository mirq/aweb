<h1><code>struct Pluginfilter</code></h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The <b><code>struct Pluginfilter</code></b> is used for passing the
data to be filtered by the
<a href="../plugin/filterplugin.html"><code>Filterplugin()</code></a>
function of a plugin module.

<h2>Structure contents</h2>

<pre>
struct Pluginfilter        /* All fields except userdata are read-only! */
{  long structsize;        /* Set to struct size by caller */
   void *handle;           /* Use in Setfiltertype() and Writefilter() */
   STRPTR data;            /* Block of data or NULL */
   long length;            /* Length of data */
   BOOL eof;               /* TRUE if EOF was reached */
   STRPTR contenttype;     /* MIME content-type of data */
   STRPTR url;             /* URL of this file */
   void *userdata;         /* For plugin private use. Delete when eof is set! */
};
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Field: <code>structsize</code> (in)</h3>
Size of this structure, in bytes. The exact size of this structure may vary
with each version of AWeb.
<p>
Do not touch parts of this structure beyond the size indicated by this field.
That is, support earlier versions of AWeb.
<p>
Do not touch parts of the structure beyond the size the plugin expects this
structure to be. That is, don't touch parts of the structure you don't
understand.

<h3>Field: <code>handle</code> (in)</h3>
An opaque handle. Use this handle in calls to the
<a href="../lib/setfiltertype.html"><code>Setfiltertype()</code></a> and
<a href="../lib/writefilter.html"><code>Writefilter()</code></a> functions.

<h3>Field: <code>data</code> (in)</h3>
If data should be filtered, this field contains a pointer to that data.
This data is <b>not</b> null-terminated. The plugin should <b>not</b>
modify this data in any way. If changed data is to be written, the plugin
should allocate a separate temporary buffer for that data.
<p>
If no data is available, this field may be NULL.

<h3>Field: <code>length</code> (in)</h3>
The length of the data that the <code>data</code> field points to.

<h3>Field: <code>eof</code> (in)</h3>
This is set to nonzero if no more data will follow for this data stream.
<p>
If this field is set, the plugin should free any private memory used
for this data stream.

<h3>Field: <code>contenttype</code> (in)</h3>
This contains a pointer to the MIME content type (e.g. "text/html") for
this data. The filter plugin can change this type with the
<a href="../lib/setfiltertype.html"><code>Setfiltertype()</code></a>
function.

<h3>Field: <code>url</code> (in)</h3>
This field points to a null-terminated string containing the URL for
this file.

<h3>Field: <code>userdata</code> (in/out)</h3>
Use this field to remember private data related to this data stream.
Allocate the memory you need, and set this field to a pointer to that
memory. In subsequent calls, this field will still point to that memory.
<p>
You must eventually free the memory yourself. The proper moment would be
at end of file (when the <code>eof</code> field is set).
