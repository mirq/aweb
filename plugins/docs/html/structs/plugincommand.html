<h1><code>struct Plugincommand</code></h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The <b><code>struct Plugincommand</code></b> is used for passing the
command and the result of the
<a href="../plugin/commandplugin.html"><code>Commandplugin()</code></a>
function of a plugin module.

<h2>Structure contents</h2>

<pre>
struct Plugincommand
{  long structsize;        /* Set to struct size by caller */
   UBYTE *command;         /* Set to command by caller, modifications
                            * by plugin allowed. */
   UBYTE *result;          /* Result allocated by plugin, freed by caller.
                            * Leave NULL if no result returned. */
   long rc;                /* Return code. 0 for success, nonzero for 
                            * warning or failure. */
};
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Field: <code>structsize</code> (in)</h3>
Size of this structure, in bytes. The exact size of this structure may vary
with the version of AWeb.
<p>
Do not touch parts of this structure beyond the size indicated by this field.
That is, support earlier versions of AWeb.
<p>
Do not touch parts of the structure beyond the size the plugin expects this
structure to be. That is, don't touch parts of the structure you don't
understand.

<h3>Field: <code>command</code> (in)</h3>
Points to a null-terminated string holding the command passed to the
plugin module. It is set by the caller. It is safe for the plugin module
to modify this string.

<h3>Field: <code>result</code> (out)</h3>
Initially set to NULL. If the command needs to return a result, the
plugin module should allocate memory to hold a null-terminated string
and let this field point to that memory.
<p>
The string <b>must</b> be allocated by one of the
<a href="../lib/index.html">awebsupport.library</a>'s
memory functions (<a href="../lib/allocmem.html">Allocmem()</a> or
<a href="../lib/dupstr.html">Dupstr()</a>). It will be freed by the
caller.

<h3>Field: <code>rc</code> (out)</h3>
The result code passed to ARexx's <b>RC</b> variable. Set to 0 for
success, or nonzero for warning or failure.
