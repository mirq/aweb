<h1>The AWeb OO model</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

AWeb internally uses its own object oriented model for representation of data.
By means of the plugin interface, this model can be expanded by the plugin
modules. This document does not explain object oriented modelling, that is
something assumed to be known to the reader.
<p>
The OO system used by AWeb is similar to BOOPSI, although it is a completely
separate system. The existing BOOPSI image and gadget models were not
useable because of AWeb's scrolling and RastPort clipping demands. Building
a new model using BOOPSI would have been possible, but I decided to build
my own system instead, for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The way BOOPSI implements inheritance is basically very good. If you
   derive a class from a certain superclass, you can only access the
   superclasses attributes through its methods. That is perfect when
   deriving from a foreign class, but if you own the superclass as well,
   it's a bit of a hassle. One of the very few things I like about C++
   is the way you can access your superclasses public attributes as if
   they were your own.
<p>
<li>Building my own central dispatcher allowed me to add a trace option.
   Simply by specifying a couple of arguments when starting AWeb, I can
   make a full trace of every single message that is sent around.
   Filtering is possible by class, or by method, or both. A great help
   when debugging.
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Dispatcher</h3>
Like BOOPSI, every class must have a dispatcher function that handles
incoming OO messages.
<p>
Invoking methods of other objects is done by calling the
<a href="lib/amethoda.html"><code>Amethod[A]()</code></a> function,
AWebs equivalent of <code>DoMethod[A]()</code>. This function forwards
the message to the dispatcher of the class.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
Deriving a class from a superclass is different from the way it is
done in BOOPSI. The object instance data structure of the derived class must
start with the data structure for the superclass. This implies that
you must know the data structure of the superclass, so either
it must be public, or it must be your own private class. It is not
possible to inherit from other classes, you should use delegation
instead. (Popularly, delegation is having a pointer to another object
and forward the messages to it.)
<p>
There is no such function as <code>DoSuperMethod()</code>, in the AWeb
OO system the central dispatcher does not know what your superclass is.
To pass a message to your superclass you must use
<a href="lib/amethodasa.html"><code>Amethodas[A]()</code></a>, AWebs
version of <code>CoerceMethod[A]()</code>.

<h2><a name=dispatcher>Implementation</a></h2>

Every object implementation must have a <b>dispatcher</b> to process
messages sent to the object.
<p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre>
   retval = Dispatcher(object, message)
   D0                A0      A1

   ULONG Dispatcher(<a href="classes/object.html">struct Aobject</a> *, <a href="methods/index.html#amessage">struct Amessage</a> *);
</pre>
<h3>Function</h3>
The dispatcher function is called whenever a message is sent to the object.
Depending on the message type (<a href=methods/index.html>method</a>),
the object code should take appropriate actions.

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Parameter
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><td valign=top>object
   <td valign=top>A pointer to the object instance that the message was sent to.
      <p>
      This will be NULL for the <a href="methods/new.html">AOM_NEW</a> method.
<tr><td valign=top>message
   <td valign=top>A pointer to the message that was sent to the object.
</table>

<h3>Results</h3>
The value to return depends on the method invoked. See the documentation
for the individual methods.
