<h1>Method: AOM_HANDLEINPUT</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOM_HANDLEINPUT</b> method is used to send incoming IntuiMessages to
the copydriver object that has become the input focus.

<h2>Message structure</h2>

The <b>AOM_HANDLEINPUT</b> method uses an <b>Aminput</b> structure:<p>

<pre>
struct Aminput
{  <a href=index.html#Amessage>struct Amessage</a> amsg;
   struct IntuiMessage *imsg;
                           /* The IntuiMessage to be handled. */
   USHORT flags;           /* AMHF_DOWNLOAD or AMHF_POPUP qualifier */
   struct Amiresult *amir;
};
</pre>
Additional return values should be returned in an <b>Amiresult</b> structure:<p>
<pre>
struct Amiresult
{  STRPTR text;            /* New status gadget text. Dynamic string. */
   <a href="../classes/object.html">struct Aobject</a> *newobject;
                           /* If not NULL, this object wants to become the active one. */
};
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Field: <code>imsg</code></h3>
The incoming IntuiMessage to be handled.<p>
Note that when processing mouse coordinates, the object must use the
<a href="../lib/clipcoords.html"><code>Clipcoords()</code></a> function to
obtain a <a href="../structs/coords.html"><code>struct Coords</code></a>,
and use its coordinates to convert the RastPort relative coordinates in the
IntuiMessage.
<p>
This field will be NULL if the AMHF_DEFER flag is set.

<h3>Field: <code>flags</code></h3>
Special indicators that may affect the processing of this message.
<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Flag
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMHF_DOWNLOAD
   <td valign=top>The download qualifier (a SHIFT key) is activated
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMHF_POPUP
   <td valign=top>The popup menu qualifier is activated
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMHF_DEFER
   <td valign=top>This message terminates a stream of input events. See
      the description of the <a href=#AMR_DEFER>AMR_DEFER</a> return
      value.
</table>
Note that the state of the AMHF_DOWNLOAD and AMHF_POPUP flags may have been
changed when receiving a IDCMP_RAWKEY event.

<h3>Field: <code>amir</code></h3>
A pointer to a structure accomodating special return values. Note that this
pointer may be NULL.

<h4>Field: <code>amir->text</code></h4>
If this is set to a dynamically allocated string, its contents will replace
the current contents of the
window's status gadget. The string <b>must</b> be allocated by one of
the <a href="../lib/index.html">awebsupport.library</a>'s
memory functions (<a href="../lib/allocmem.html">Allocmem()</a> or
<a href="../lib/dupstr.html">Dupstr()</a>).

<h4>Field: <code>amir->newobject</code></h4>
If the input event causes another object to become active (like when the
TAB key was hit), set this to a pointer to the other object. You must
also return AMR_NOREUSE.<p>
Of course this feature can only be used if you have a way to determine
the other object, so you must own both objects yourself.

<h3>Return value</h3>
The method must return one of the following values:
<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Value
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_ACTIVE
   <td valign=top>The object wants to remain the input focus.
<tr><th align=left valign=top><a name=AMR_DEFER>AMR_DEFER</a>
   <td valign=top>The object wants to remain the input focus, but wants
      to be notified when the current stream of input events stops.<p>
      This is most useful for objects handling large streams of events
      like mouse movements, while the resulting action may take quite
      some time. Instead of doing the lenghty processing after each mouse
      movement, the object can choose to do only some visual feedback,
      and do the full processing when the mouse movement stops.<p>
      To achieve this, return AMR_DEFER. As long as there are IntuiMessages
      waiting, you will be sent more AOM_HANDLEINPUT messages. When no more
      IntuiMessages are available, you will receive one extra AOM_HANDLEINPUT
      message with a NULL <code>imsg</code> pointer, and the AMHF_DEFER
      flag set.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_REUSE
   <td valign=top>The object wants to be removed from the input focus,
      and the IntuiMessage must be reused. This may cause activation
      of other objects.<p>
      This object will be sent an <a href="goinactive.html">AOM_GOINACTIVE</a>
      message.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_NOREUSE
   <td valign=top>The object wants to be removed from the input focus,
      and the IntuiMessage must be thrown away.<p>
      This object will be sent an <a href="goinactive.html">AOM_GOINACTIVE</a>
      message.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_NOCARE
   <td valign=top>The object does not know how to process this input event.
      You will remain active or be deactivated, as per default.
</table>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

Copydriver objects should implement this method if the visible object has
user-selectable areas under the driver's control. Note that normal HTML
image maps are handled by the AWeb core, and must not be implemented by
the copydriver. If the copydriver understands this method, it should
return TRUE to an AOM_GET of the AOCDV_Shapes attribute.
<p>
Implementation of this method largely depends on the type of user
interaction supported by the object. However, a typical simple
implementation of this method would be:
<p>
<pre>
   ULONG retval;
   struct Coords *coo;
   long x,y;

   /* Let the AWeb core decide for IDCMP classes we don't use */
   retval=AMR_NOCARE;

   if(aminput->imsg)
   {  switch(aminput->imsg->Class)
      {  case IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE:
            /* Check if mouse pointer is still over us. Note that 
             * the mouse pointer may have moved outside our bounds */
            coo=Clipcoords(object->cframe,NULL);
            x=aminput->imsg->MouseX - coo->dx - object->aox;
            y=aminput->imsg->MouseY - coo->dy - object->aoy;
            if(x>=0 && x<object->aow && y>=0 && y<object->aoh)
            {  /* If appropriate, check if mouse pointer is over
                * any 'hot' area and return a new aminput->amir->text */
               retval=AMR_ACTIVE;
            }
            else
            {  /* Mouse pointer has moved away from us. */
               retval=AMR_REUSE;
            }
            Unclipcoords(coo);
            break;

         case IDCMP_RAWKEY:
            /* Check if the AMHF_DOWNLOAD or AMHF_POPUP flag in
             * aminput->flags have changed and take appropriate
             * action. */
            retval=AMR_ACTIVE;
            break;

         case IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS:
            if(aminput->imsg->Code==SELECTUP)
            {  /* Mouse button was released above us.
                * Do any appropriate action.
                */
            }
            /* In any case, deactivate. */
            retval=AMR_NOREUSE;
            break;
      }
   }
   return retval;
