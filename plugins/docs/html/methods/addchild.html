<h1>Method: AOM_ADDCHILD</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOM_ADDCHILD</b> method is used to add an object (the child) into
a relationship with another object (the parent). Relationships are generally
of order 1:N, that is one parent can be related to many child objects.
<p>
Eventuelly the child must be removed from the relationship by the
<a href=remchild.html>AOM_REMCHILD</a> method.

<h2>Message structure</h2>

The <b>AOM_ADDCHILD</b> method uses an <b>Amadd</b> structure:<p>

<pre>
struct Amadd
{  <a href=index.html#Amessage>struct Amessage</a> amsg;
   <a href="../classes/object.html">struct Aobject</a> *child;
   ULONG relation;
};
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Note that the publicly available relationships will not use the
object's <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> fields (the embedded
MinNode structure that every object starts with) to implement the
relationship. Therefore these fields remain free for your own use.

<h3>Field: <code>child</code></h3>
The child object to be added into the relationship.

<h3>Field: <code>relation</code></h3>
Identifies the relationship to add the child object into.
In general, an object can be parent in more than one relationship.

<h3>Return value</h3>
The return value for this method is not defined.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Plugin classes generally need not to implement this method.
