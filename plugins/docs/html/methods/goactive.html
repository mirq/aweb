<h1>Method: AOM_GOACTIVE</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOM_GOACTIVE</b> method is used to make the object the current
input focus. Before an AOM_GOACTIVE message is sent to an object, it must
have replied an <a href=hittest.html>AOM_HITTEST</a> message with a
AMR_NEWHIT or AMR_OLDHIT return value.

<h2>Message structure</h2>

The <b>AOM_GOACTIVE</b> method uses an <b>Amgoactive</b> structure:<p>

<pre>
struct Amgoactive
{  <a href=index.html#Amessage>struct Amessage</a> amsg;
   struct IntuiMessage *imsg;
                           /* The IntuiMessage that caused activation. The
                            * MouseX/Y coordinates in this message are RastPort
                            * coordinates and have to be corrected with Coords
                            * offsets (you have to request a Coords yourself). */
   USHORT flags;           /* AMHF_DOWNLOAD or AMHF_POPUP qualifier */
};
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Field: <code>imsg</code></h3>
A pointer to an IntuiMessage structure describing the input event that caused
activation of the object. Because the object immediately (for the same mouse
position) replied to an <a href=hittest.html>AOM_HITTEST</a> message with a
AMR_NEWHIT or AMR_OLDHIT return value, the object can safely assume that the
mouse coordinates fall inside an activatable area.
<p>
When processing mouse coordinates, the object must use the
<a href="../lib/clipcoords.html"><code>Clipcoords()</code></a> function to
obtain a <a href="../structs/coords.html"><code>struct Coords</code></a>,
and use its coordinates to convert the RastPort relative coordinates in the
IntuiMessage.

<h3>Field: <code>flags</code></h3>
Special indicators that may affect the processing of this message.
<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Flag
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMHF_DOWNLOAD
   <td valign=top>The download qualifier (a SHIFT key) is activated
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMHF_POPUP
   <td valign=top>The popup menu qualifier is activated
</table>

<h3>Return value</h3>
The method must return one of the following values:
<table border>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Value
   <th align=left valign=top>Description
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_ACTIVE
   <td valign=top>The object wants to become the input focus. Future
      IntuiMessages will be sent to the object by an
      <a href="handleinput.html">AOM_HANDLEINPUT</a> message.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_CHANGED
   <td valign=top>The object has succesfully processed the activation event,
      and possibly changed its status, but does not want to receive further
      IntuiMessages.<p>
      The object will be sent an <a href="goinactive.html">AOM_GOINACTIVE</a>
      message immediately afterwards.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AMR_NOREUSE
   <td valign=top>The object does not want to become the input focus.
</table>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Copydriver objects should implement this method if the visible object has
user-selectable areas under the driver's control. Note that normal HTML
image maps are handled by the AWeb core, and must not be implemented by
the copydriver. If the copydriver understands this method, it should
return TRUE to an AOM_GET of the AOCDV_Shapes attribute.
<p>
Implementation of this method largely depends on the type of user
interaction supported by the object. However, a typical simple
implementation of this method would be to send an
<a href=render.html>AOM_RENDER</a> message to the object itself with the
AMRF_UPDATESELECTED flag set, then return AMR_ACTIVE.
