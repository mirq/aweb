<h1>Method: AOM_DISPOSE</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOM_DISPOSE</b> method is used to delete an object instance.

<h2>Message structure</h2>

The <b>AOM_DISPOSE</b> method uses a standard
<a href=index.html#Amessage>Amessage</a> structure.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Return value</h3>
The return value for this method is not defined.
<p>
After sending this message, the object does no longer exist.

Typically, the class frees all resources allocated by the object, then passes this
method to its superclass object. The root class AOTP_OBJECT
will delete the memory occupied by the object data structure itself.
