<h1>Method: AOM_GOINACTIVE</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The <b>AOM_GOINACTIVE</b> method is used to let an object know that
it has been removed from the input focus.

<h2>Message structure</h2>

The <b>AOM_GOINACTIVE</b> method uses a standard
<a href=index.html#Amessage>Amessage</a> structure.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Return value</h3>
The return value for this method is not defined.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

Copydriver objects should implement this method if the visible object has
user-selectable areas under the driver's control. Note that normal HTML
image maps are handled by the AWeb core, and must not be implemented by
the copydriver. If the copydriver understands this method, it should
return TRUE to an AOM_GET of the AOCDV_Shapes attribute.
<p>
Implementation of this method largely depends on the type of user
interaction supported by the object. However, a typical simple
implementation of this method would be to send an
<a href=render.html>AOM_RENDER</a> message to the object itself with the
AMRF_UPDATENORMAL flag set.
