AWeb plugin module API
======================

This is version 2.0APL of the AWeb plugin module API.

Although it includes about everything to allow you to
write simple things like image decoders, you'll probably
need more for really complex things. If you need anything
that doesn't seem to be there, don't hesitate to contact
me. It might already be there, but just not made public yet.

Also note that the OO trace facility mentioned in oomodel.html
is disabled in the current public version of AWeb. If you
think you need it, let me know.
