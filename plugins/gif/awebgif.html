   AWeb GIF plugin</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
The <em>awebgif</em> plugin for AWeb allows you to view all GIF images.
Features include:
<ul>
<li>Optional progressive display of loading images
<li>Optional playback of animated GIFs
<li>Support for transparent images
<li>Support for scaling
<li>Support for CyberGraphics
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Follow these steps to install the AWeb GIF plugin.
<ol>
<li>
Run the supplied Installer script. It will copy the necessary files to a
drawer <code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is
located.
<br><br>
<li>
<form action="x-aweb:rexx/AWebPath:AWebPlugin/Docs/awebgif.awebrx">
Run the <input type=submit value="Setup script">.
</form>
</ol>

<h2>Manual Installation</h2>
If, for some reason, you don't want to install the plugin automatically, you
can install it by hand.
<ol>
<li>
Copy the file named <code>awebgif.awebplugin</code> to a location of your
choice. The recommended location for plugins like this is a drawer
<code>AWebPlugins</code> in the drawer where the AWeb program is located.
<br><br>
<li>
Start AWeb, open the browser settings and bring up the <em>Viewers</em> page.
Select the entry for MIME type <code>IMAGE/GIF</code> and change the following
settings:
<ul>
   <li>Action: "AWeb Plugin (A)"
   <li>Name: the location where you copied the file <code>awebgif.awebplugin</code>
   <li>Arguments: leave blank or supply optional parameters, see below
</ul>
<br><br>
<li>
Don't forget to save your settings.
</ol>

<h2><a name=parameters>Parameters</a></h2>
The awebgif plugin supports two optional parameters. You can type the chosen
parameters in the "Arguments:" field of the settings window. Separate the
parameters by a comma or space, if you specify more than one.

<dl>
<dt><code><b>PROGRESS=</b>0|<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Specifies the number of image scan lines to decode before the display is
   updated. A higher number is faster but results in chunkier building of the
   image. PROGRESS=1 gives the smoothest progressive display but is relatively
   slow. The default value is 4, which is a good compromise between speed and
   visual attractiveness.
<p>
   If you specify PROGRESS=0, progressive display is disabled. The image is
   not displayed until decoding is ready.
<p>
<dt><code><b>LOOPS=</b>-1|0|<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Specifies how many times animations should be played back. The animation
   playback will stop when the specified number of cycles has been played.
   Default is -1, which means playback an infinite number of times.
<p>
   If you specify LOOPS=0, animations are not played back.
   Second and later animation frames are not even decoded. This saves CPU
   speed and memory (precious chip memory on non-CyberGraphics systems).
<p>
<dt><code><b>LOWPRI</b></code>
<dd>The LOWPRI argument will run the decoder at a lower priority than default.
   If you are using your Amiga for other tasks while AWeb is downloading images,
   this feature helps you to keep the GUI responsive when many images are being
   decoded.
   However, if you are running CPU intensive tasks this argument could stop
   images from being processed alltogether.
<p>
   Note that the LOWPRI argument might not be effective when you use a custom task
   scheduler like Executive. Use task name "AWebGif decoder" to configure the
   decoder task in custom schedulers.
</dl>

<h2>Commands</h2>
AWeb version 3.3 or higher supports plugin commands. This plugin
features three commands:<br>
(upper or lower case doesn't matter)
<dl>
<dt><code><b>STOPANIM</b></code>
<dd>Immediately stops all current and future animations.
<p>
<dt><code><b>STARTANIM</b></code>
<dd>Restarts all animations after they were stopped earlier with the
   <code>STOPANIM</code> command.
<p>
<dt><code><b>ANIM</b></code>
<dd>Returns the animation state: "0" if animations are stopped, "1" otherwise.
</dl>
Example of usage:<br>
In the AWeb GUI settings requester, assign the following command to a key,
to a button or to a popup menu item:<br>
<pre>
   PLUGIN "awebgif.awebplugin" "StopAnim"
</pre>
to stop animations.<br>
Likewise, the command:
<pre>
   PLUGIN "awebgif.awebplugin" "StartAnim"
</pre>
will restart animations.

<h2>Support</h2>
This distribution of AWeb comes with no support, however the AWeb Mailing list has many users and you are <A HREF="FILE:///AWebPath:Docs/GettingHelp.html">encouraged to subscribe</A> if you haven't aleady done so.
