Revision:  17

    Add support for AmiSSL 4.2  A minimum of verson 4.2 is required to use more 
    than one connection  process at at time so AWeb will enforce this minimum. 
    A error requestor to inform about incorrect AmiSSL version.  Fix a number of 
    warnings.    


Tue, 25 Feb 2014  -  17:29:34
Revision:  16

    Add support for new built in mouse pointer types in AmigaOS 4.1 build Improve 
    security by limiting Cyphers and enforcing SSL3 minimum Various fixes.   


Sat, 26 May 2012  -  01:13:25
Revision:  15

    REplace all calls to CreatemsgPort and DeleteMsgPort with ACreatemsgport ADeletemsgport. 
    Implement said functiosn with AlloSysObject for AmigaOS 4 and CreateMsgPort 
    DeleteMsgPort for other operating systems.  Fix a few pointer type warnings 
       


Fri, 25 May 2012  -  02:36:54
Revision:  14

    AWeb created and deleted apports like crazy. Now the apport is created once 
    at the beginning of the app and deleted the end at the same time as the other 
    ports.   


Fri, 25 May 2012  -  01:50:51
Revision:  13

    AWeb would only create an appport if opened on the default public screen. If 
    opened on a named public screen (even if that name was Workbench!) it wouldn't 
    create the port. AWeb now always creates an appport whatever screen it opens 
    on.   


Fri, 25 May 2012  -  00:27:42
Revision:  12

    Extend ARexx NEW to enabling opening the new window on a specific named screen 
      


Thu, 24 May 2012  -  23:11:09
Revision:  11

    Extend AREXX NEW to set LEFT and TOP of a new window. Add missing left and 
    top attributes to javascrip window.open() spec.   


Thu, 24 May 2012  -  19:40:38
Revision:  10

    Use AmigaOS 4 sysiclass for iconify gadget  


Thu, 24 May 2012  -  18:35:10
Revision:  9

    The gadget / layout craetion code was moved to the wrong place so that it was 
    not called on uniconfication. Corrected.  Save the values of winow->Width and 
    window->Height after opening (as they are no longer always calculated by AWeb) 
    and ensure newwidth and newheight are zeroed after use, so that on uniconfication 
    etc they are not reused.    


Thu, 24 May 2012  -  17:27:28
Revision:  8

    Fix long term bug where javascript.open() would open an incorrectly sized window. 
     The old code would determine the window bordersizes, gadget layout sizes etc 
    from those of an existing window. But this was only valid if the two windows 
    were to share identical specs, in particular if they both were to have or not 
    have navigation gadgets.  The new code allocates the entire gadgetry and imagery 
    before the window is opened, allowing LayLimits to be used to determine the 
    required window size.  Some additional calls to Closewindfow() were added to 
    cleanup resources in the event of failing to open a window.  Fix a few warnings.

      macro which output the Date in the Format Mmm.DD.YYY no AWeb file have a
      standard conform Datestring. With the use of this File the problem is
      solved. If it works on AOS4 and MOS too then the Tubsengine and Makefile
      for these systems can be changed to use this file too.
    * Tubsengine: redirect the __AMIGADATE__ macro to the builddate executable.
    * Makefile: Make sure that build/builddate is build before all other files.
      The file is always build because i see no other way to include it.
      But the build should only take some seconds.

      the feature to print out the warnings to the console. You can switch off
      that feature if you call 'make WARN=0 ...'. ('0' can be something except 1)
      This makes only sense for OS3 builds so it is only implemented in Tubsengine.
      (The other OS produce still too much warnings.)

2009-07-23: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * user/Docs/Configuring/nwmail.html: Because a unpatched RAM: device allow
      only a file name length of 30 i truncate some filenames to fit this size.

2009-06-15: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * all #?.c and #?.h Files: Only cosmetic changes: Remove all whitespaces
      at end of line and replace all tabs with 3 spaces. Reformat some files.

2009-06-09: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * Makefile: Add touch aweb/version.c to get always a correct build date
      in the version string.

2009-06-09: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>

2009-06-09: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * awebcommon/libraries.c: Display a english error message if the
      locale.library isn't available because this message can't localized
      without the locale.library. That avoid a possible crash if the
      locale.library isn't available.

2009-06-09: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * aweb/aweb.c: Move the Openlib("locale.library"...) call to the top that the
      locale.library is available at the first access to a localized string.
      That avoid a possible crash if e.g. the asl.library isn't available.

2009-06-04: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * awebcfg/include/cfglocale.h, awebcfg.cd, catalogs/#?/awebcfg.ct:
      fix for the Catcomp warnings about unknown formatting commands
      and update all awebcfg.ct files according to the changes.

2009-06-04: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * awebcfg/awebcfg.c: Print a empty line before and after
      the warning if no AWebCfg window could be opened.

      Forget the Linefeeds (\n) in the translation.

2009-05-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * catalogs/deutsch/awebcfg.ct:
    * catalogs/german/awebcfg.ct:
      Update german translation according to the latest changes.

2009-05-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * catalogs/#?/awebcfg.ct: Update all awebcfg.ct files
      according to the latest changes.

2009-05-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * awebcfg/awebcfg.c, awebcfg/include/cfglocale.h, awebcfg.cd:
      Print out a warning if no AWebCfg window could be opened.
      The usual fault is a typo in the command line or forget
      to use at least one of the 4 switches.

2009-05-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * catalogs/deutsch/aweb.ct:

    * awebcfg/cfgui.c: Insert the first 2 chars of a selected entry
      in a chooser dropdown menu into the associated stringgadget.
      This and the latest 4 patches should fix bug #227.

2009-05-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>

    * awebcommon/defprefs.c: Changed a strchr(cmd,';') into a
      strrchr(cmd,';') call in Loadprefs() (case SVF_MENU)
      that allow also semicolons in the URL.
      If the URL contain a semicolon then the URL must be quoted.

    * aweb/print.c: make some changes to eradicate all warnings
      and moved the '#warning' warnings inside '#if defined(__amigaos4__)'
      because they are OS4 related.

2009-01-22: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * aweb/application.c: make some changes to eradicate all warnings
      also for the developer version.

    * awebcfg/cfgnw.c: Deleted the code which was trying to set LISTBROWSER_EditTags->
      STRINGA_BufferPos to 4 for the nocookie, noproxy and nocache lists. This code
      wasn't working and the listbrowser set the cursor anyway at the latest cursor
      position. I assume it's also still (or again) working for the other OS Versions.
      This fixes bug 302. -> http://bugz.naff.dk/show_bug.cgi?id=302

2009-01-19: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * aweb/cache.c: make some changes to eradicate all warnings
      and reformat the file to get the 'AWeb style'.

      locale.library twice for the developer version.

2009-01-05: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>
    * aweb/aweblibs/include/inline/awebjs.h: Fixing a nasty bug introduced
      on 2006/05/24. The entry point for Jallowgc() was wrong so Jallowgc was
      never called on OS3.x machines. Instead of that Jsetscreen() was called
      which is totally nonsense. That maybe fixes a lot of JS issues on OS3.x
      machines including the Memory Hits if the JS Debug window or the Requester
      "JavaScript runs for one minute" is opened.

2008-12-24: Frank (Opi) Weber <opionline@yahoo.de>

      any non matching message in the applications windowmsgs list. Again removes
      Forbid()

    * aweb/aweb.c aweblibs/awebs/jexe.c:
      MOS needs special code to handle stack overflows.
      (Patch by Illka 'itix' lehtoranta)
    * Tubsengine: removed the setup:: target, now directories
      are created only when needed, on the fly.
    * Lots of files all around the place, during the past days:
        o  removed all instances of the LIBFUNC_C macro
        o  regenerated the inline includes for the various
           platforms, using the sfdc tool by Martin Blom, so
           that Foo() may now be invoked like __Foo_WB(base).
           This was necessary to make the function calling syntax
           the same, in some critical places, between AmigaOS4 and
           the other platforms
        o  changed the aweblibs to export a new function named
           AwebGetTaskFunc(id), which returns a function suited
           to be the entry point of an Aweb Task object. This way
           the function can use the standard calling convention
        o  many other changes that served to make Aweb less dependent
           on 68k semantics. Still lots of work needs to be done.
