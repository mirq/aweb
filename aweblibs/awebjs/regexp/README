This directory contains the source code for PCRE (perl compatable regular expressions)
used by AWeb for javascript regular expression support. See pcre.c for copyright info.

The files present were either imported direct from the pcre package or generated with
the configure script from that package and then imported into the AWeb environment.

The code remains substantially unaltered, with the exceptionof ome (very) minor type
changes
