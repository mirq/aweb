DESCRIPTION

The titlebar.image is a shared library which, when opened, adds to the system
a public BOOPSI image class called "tbiclass". This class implements several
image types suitable for use as imagery of gadgets added to the titlebar of
a window, such as an "iconify" image, a "pop-up" image, and so on. Also, a
general purpose "empty" (border-only) image is provided, to be used as the
background of more specialized titlebar images.

The purpose of "tbiclass" is to offer developers an easy way to implement
the most common additional titlebar gadgets without having to draw or
code their imagery themselves, and with the added benefit of standardizing
the size and appearance of this kind of gadgets. For instance, developers
needing an iconify gadget were forced for years to hard-code its imagery
into their application, leading to a plethora of similar, but different,
variants of the same gadget across various programs.

The library is freeware; if you use it, you are allowed to distribute it
with your software, typically as a stand-alone file (you could also add a
section for it in your application's installation script).

Using "tbiclass" is very simple: you just need to open the titlebar.image
library in order to add the class to the system, and then close it when you
don't require the class anymore (and have freed all of its instances).

Once the class has been added to the system, you can use NewObject() in the
usual way to create new "tbiclass" instances. See the "Class documentation"
section to learn which tags are recognized by the class, as well as more
information about the class in general.

Important note: a more refined version of "tbiclass" is also added to the
system at boot time by the VisualPrefs utility (a patch to modify the look
of the Amiga GUI). If the titlebar.image library, when opened, finds that a
class named "tbiclass" already exists, it won't create another, but still
will open successfully, so your code doesn't need any changes to take this
special case into account.

The only thing to remember is, you should NOT open the titlebar.image library
if your program is launched in the Startup-sequence _before_ the line where
VisualPrefs is usually started (which is just before IPrefs), or else the
patch won't run properly. If you absolutely need to place your program in
the Startup-sequence before VisualPrefs/IPrefs, at least offer the user
an option to avoid opening the titlebar.image library.
Anyway, this shouldn't be a problem for the vast majority of applications...

The class documentation applies to both versions of "tbiclass", save where
otherwise noted.


CLASS DOCUMENTATION

Class:        tbiclass
Superclass:   imageclass
Include File: <images/titlebar.h>

This is a class of images suitable for use as imagery of gadgets added to
a window titlebar. As of version 40, there are 6 possible "tbiclass" images
to choose from:

TBI_POPUPIMAGE      A MUI-like "pop-up" titlebar gadget image
TBI_MUIIMAGE        A MUI-like "settings" titlebar gadget image
TBI_SNAPSHOTIMAGE   A MUI-like "snapshot" titlebar gadget image
TBI_ICONIFYIMAGE    An "iconify" titlebar gadget image
TBI_PADLOCKIMAGE    A DirOpus "padlock" titlebar gadget image
TBI_TBFRAMEIMAGE    A general-purpose empty titlebar gadget image

These image types are an extension to those already offered by "sysiclass";
in fact, "tbiclass" is used mostly the same way as "sysiclass" (see below
for its methods and attributes).

It's worth noticing that all "tbiclass" image instances will have an
Image->LeftEdge value of -1. This shouldn't be modified, and you should
place your titlebar gadgets accordingly. The reason for this apparently
strange behavior is that Intuition titlebar gadget images, too, work
this way, and we should try to stay as compatible with Intuition as
possible.

To correctly compute the horizontal position (relative to the window's
right edge) of a new titlebar gadget, you should use the TBI_RELPOS()
macro provided in <images/titlebar.h>. See the included test program's
source for an example of how to use the TBI_RELPOS() macro.

Also, make sure you adjust your gadget's size if necessary, to adapt it
to the returned image's size.

There are actually two versions of this class: a disk-based one, implemented
by the freely distributable "titlebar.image" library, and another, more
refined, added to the system by the VisualPrefs program at boot time.
Applications needing this class should always ship with the "titlebar.image"
library, and use it without worrying about the presence of VisualPrefs in the
system: if it's running, its "tbiclass" version will be used automatically.

The _only_ exception to this rule is when your application is run in the
Startup-sequence before VisualPrefs; in this case, you should offer the
user an option to avoid opening "titlebar.image", otherwise the disk-based
version of the class would be added to the system and VisualPrefs wouldn't
be able to add its own version. This is, however, a very unlikely scenario;
in all foreseeable cases, an application opening windows shouldn't be run
so early in the Startup-sequence.

New Methods:

None.

Changed Methods:

OM_NEW - After creation of the image by the superclass, this method
initializes the "tbiclass" instance data according to the contents of
the passed tag list of attributes.

OM_DISPOSE - This method frees all the resources allocated in the OM_NEW
method.

OM_SET - This method allows to change a few of the image attributes and
checks their bounds integrity.

OM_GET - This method allows to retrieve the value of the most relevant
image attributes.

IM_DRAW - This method performs the actual rendering of the image, taking
into account its various attributes and the screen's DrawInfo pens.

IM_DRAWFRAME - Like IM_DRAW, but uses the size specified in the impDraw
message rather than the one in the image structure.

Attributes:

SYSIA_DrawInfo (IS) - This is absolutely mandatory. You MUST pass a DrawInfo
                      pointer to "tbiclass" or NewObject() will fail.

SYSIA_Which (ISG) - To specify which image you want; currently there are six
                    image types, defined in <images/titlebar.h>:

                    TBI_POPUPIMAGE
                    TBI_MUIIMAGE
                    TBI_SNAPSHOTIMAGE
                    TBI_ICONIFYIMAGE
                    TBI_PADLOCKIMAGE
                    TBI_TBFRAMEIMAGE

                    Note that the TBI_ prefix was added to the names of these
                    constants in version 40.17, to avoid clashes with the new
                    "sysiclass" image types of AmigaOS 4.x (and now also 3.2,
                    in the case of ICONIFYIMAGE).

IA_Width, IA_Height (ISG) - If these are not passed, the image will have by
                            default the same size of the depth gadget image.
                            NOTE: prior to version 40.15, these tags were
                            only recognized by the TBFRAMEIMAGE type; the
                            other image types ignored them and always had
                            the same size as the depth gadget image.
                            [VisualPrefs' "tbiclass" still works this way.]

SYSIA_ReferenceFont (IS) - This is ignored if IA_Height is explicitly used.
                           NOTE: prior to version 40.15, this tag was only
                           recognized by the TBFRAMEIMAGE type; the other
                           image types ignored it and always had the same
                           height of the depth gadget image.
                           [VisualPrefs' "tbiclass" still works this way.]

TBIA_ContentsBox (G) - To ask the image about the position and size of its
                       actual "contents box" relative to the image itself.
                       Said box is the part where, if you need to, you can
                       add any further custom imagery. This probably only
                       makes sense with TBFRAMEIMAGE images. To position
                       correctly the box, you should add its Left and Top
                       offsets to those of the image. Note that this
                       attribute is useless for the disk-based version of
                       the class, as the returned size will always be equal
                       to the full image size; it is only relevant for the
                       "tbiclass" version created by VisualPrefs. The value
                       you pass to this tag must be a pointer to an IBox
                       structure. Do NOT pass a longword pointer! (V40.12)

TBIA_FullFrame (I)- This is only recognized by the TBFRAMEIMAGE type; also,
                    it only makes any difference on systems where either
                    VisualPrefs or AmigaOS 4.x is running. Set it to TRUE
                    to get an image which also contains an inner frame, if
                    the current style normally has one. This is best suited
                    when the image's contents are graphic in nature. Set it
                    to FALSE to get an image which has at most the outer
                    frame; this is instead best suited when the image shall
                    contain text (as the inner frame might be too small to
                    render the text into, depending on the font in use).
                    The default is FALSE. (V40.17)


PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE

An example of usage of "titlebar.image" and "tbiclass" could be given by
the following code fragment:

   ...
   #include <images/titlebar.h>
   #include <clib/titlebarimage_protos.h>
   #include <pragmas/titlebarimage_pragmas.h>

   ...
   
   struct Library *TitlebarImageBase;

   ...

   /* Open the library */
   
   if (!(TitlebarImageBase = OpenLibrary("Images/titlebar.image",40)))
   {
      ComplainAndExit();
   }

   ...

   /* Create the image */

   if (!(iconifyimage = NewObject(NULL,"tbiclass",SYSIA_Which,TBI_ICONIFYIMAGE,
                                                  SYSIA_DrawInfo,dri,
                                                  TAG_END)))
   {
      iconifyimage = builtin_iconifyimage;  /* If really needed... */
   }

   /* Use the image */

   gad->GadgetRender = iconifyimage;
   ...

   /* Free the image */

   if (iconifyimage != builtin_iconifyimage)
   {
      DisposeObject(iconifyimage);
   }

   ...
   
   /* Close the library */
   
   CloseLibrary(TitlebarImageBase);
   
   ...

A complete example program can also be found in the distribution archive.


TO DO

Future releases might add the following features:

 o More image types.

 o Some more code optimizations.
 
And of course, I'm open to any suggestion about how to improve the class.


HISTORY

40.18 (5.5.2021)
 - Added support for customizable window titlebar heights as introduced
   in AmigaOS 3.2.
 - ICONIFYIMAGE now renders actual sysiclass imagery under AmigaOS 3.2.
 - Updated the <images/titlebar.h> header file, to prevent clashes with
   image type definitions from the AmigaOS 3.2 or 4.x includes.
 - Cleaned up the documentation and the example source code a little.

40.17 (26.2.2003)
 - Improved the V50 sysiclass support.

40.16 (22.4.2002)
 - Added support for the new sysiclass images of Intuition V50 (OS 4.0).

40.15 (14.5.2001)
 - Now the attributes IA_Width, IA_Height and IA_ReferenceFont apply to
   all image types, rather than only to the TBFRAMEIMAGE type.

40.14 (7.2.2001)
 - Now the images look correctly also on two-color screens.

40.13 (19.1.2001)
 - Corrected the height of the iconify image so that it always matches
   the height of the system's zoom image.
 - Added a new macro to automatically compute the correct horizontal
   position of a titlebar gadget using a "tbiclass" instance as its image.

40.12 (7.10.99)
 - Added a new attribute to ask the image about its inner dimensions.

40.11 (7.9.98)

   NAME
      titlebar.image -- create an image suitable for titlebar gadgets

   FUNCTION
      The titlebar.image shared library implements a public BOOPSI image
      class, called "tbiclass", which provides the most commonly used images
      for gadgets added by applications to the titlebar of their windows.
      Examples of this are the ubiquitous "iconify" gadget or DirOpus 5's
      "padlock" gadget.
      
      All programs using this class will automatically get the same look for
      their titlebar images. This is probably better than having myriads of
      different versions of the same image...
      
      The titlebar.image library is freeware; the idea is that if your
      software needs images for gadgets in window titlebars, you can simply
      place the library into your distribution archive and let the users
      install it to their machine alongside your application(s), which will
      then be able to open and use it.

      You can use "tbiclass" just like "sysiclass"; they're both sub-classes
      of "imageclass". A "tbiclass" image can be created in the usual way,
      by calling NewObject() with the tags described in the class reference
      documentation.

      Of course, if NewObject() fails, you should provide a built-in fallback
      image for your titlebar gadget. However, as this occurrence isn't very
      likely (the class requires very little memory), you can keep your
      built-in images very simple.

      To be able to create and use "tbiclass" objects in an application,
      you first have to open the titlebar.image library with OpenLibrary().
      Once you have done this, you shouldn't close the library until all of
      your "tbiclass" objects have been freed.

      For a complete description of the "tbiclass" class and its features,
      see the class reference documentation in the --background-- paragraph.

   TAGS
      For the full list of "tbiclass" attributes, see the class reference
      documentation in the --background-- paragraph.

   WARNING
      Don't close the titlebar.image library if you still have some instances
      of "tbiclass" images hanging around!

   BUGS
      None known.
