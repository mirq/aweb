If you're an user, you shouldn't need to worry about this archive; any
application requiring the "titlebar.image" BOOPSI class should already
come with the library file included in its own distribution archive.
That said, in case you encounter one that doesn't, you can simply copy
the file to your system by running the supplied installation script.

If you're a developer and need to add extra gadgets to the titlebar of
your application's window(s), you're free (and encouraged) to include
the "titlebar.image" library file - as well as any other contents of
this archive you may require - into your distribution archive, and use
the "tbiclass" image class implemented by the library.
