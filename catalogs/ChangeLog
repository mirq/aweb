    * Readded the foreign laungue named directories as OS3.x requires them
      (or seems to at least).
    * all files name must now be lower case so that make can deal with them
      consistantly, the Makefile.tubs converts the result to the appropriate case
      on compilation.

    * Renamed the directories using their English name to avoid charset
      display problems when using certain fonts (e.g. you can't see
      "français" properly using a greek font) and for better compliance
      with AmigaOS 4. Filenames are now consistent as well.
    * Made all version strings and introductory locale commands consistent
      (3.x), fixed some malformations, removed the fluff at the beginning
      and added a CVS ID. The credits removed will go in the docs later on.
    * bosnian/AWebCfg.ct: fixed typos in MSG_SET_HLP_P, MSG_SET_HLP_T,
      MSG_SET_FD_H2, MSG_SET_FD_STRONG
    * danish/AWeb.ct:
        - fixed the duplicated shortcut in the cookie manager window (bug #26)
        - both "Control/Copy block" and "Project/Close window" were using
          RAmiga-K
        - dropped another two dupes in the Hotlist manager
        - dropped the trailing dots in MSG_FILE_OPEN
    * spanish/AWeb.ct: fixed translation error in MSG_SSLWARN_CERT_TEXT
      (my fault)
