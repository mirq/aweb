<h1>&nbsp; Installation</h1>

<h2>Installing AWeb</h2>
Installing AWeb is straightforward. Just double-click the Install icon.
<p>
The archive contains three different Workbench icons for AWeb: for the
standard Workbench, for MagicWB, and for NewIcons. The installation process
will ask you which you want to install. The other icons are saved in a
separate drawer so you can switch icons later.
<p>
AWeb needs some <a href=classact.html>ClassAct</a> classes.
These are
included in the archive, and the installation process will ask you if
you want to install them. You are strongly encouraged to do so. If you
do not install ClassAct, you have to make sure that AWeb can find its
classes, for instance by executing the <code>MakeAssign</code> script
before you start AWeb. If you <em>do</em> install ClassAct, you don't
have to worry about this.

<h2>Configuring the AWeb plugins</h2>
To configure the AWeb plugins, please refer to the Plugin documentation in the AwebPlugin/Docs/ directory.

<h2>Configuring the JFIF datatype</h2>
<em>If you use the JFIF datatype (by Christoph Feck, TowerSystems), then
please read this:</em>
<p>
The JFIF datatype doesn't seem to handle shareable pens on public screens
correctly under all circumstances.
You have to install AWeb in the datatype or else AWeb will not be able to
show inline JPEG images.
<p>
In the JFIF preference editor, you must add an application named
<code><b>AWebIP</b></code> (AWeb Image Processing), and then select
<em>Single-Pass Quantization</em> (in the GadTools version of the
preference editor) or <em>One-pass</em> (in the MUI version).

<h2>The AWebLib drawer</h2>
In order to reduce the size of the executable, some less frequently used parts
of AWeb are located in separate files. AWeb expects these files to be found
in the <code>AWebLib</code> subdrawer.
You must not move these files out of their drawer, or else some functions
of AWeb may cease to work.
