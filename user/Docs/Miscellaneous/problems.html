<h1>&nbsp; Common problems</h1>

Listed below are some common problems you might encounter, and their
solution.

<ul>
<li><em>AWeb won't start. It says it can't find xxx.image or xxx.gadget.
   </em><br>
   Probably you haven't installed the latest ClassAct classes. You can find
   them on <a href="ftp://ftp.thule.no/pub/classact/">ftp://ftp.thule.no/pub/classact/</a>.
<p>
<li><em>AWeb crashes when loading a GIF image
   </em><br>
   The commonly used ZGif datatype version 39.16 had a bug. Be sure to use
   version 39.18 or better of the ZGif datatype, or another GIF datatype.
<p>
<li><em>When I try to print the document it just does nothing
   </em><br>
   You probably try to print from a screen with more than 256 colours. Most
   printer drivers can't handle these kind of screens. You have to change
   your screen mode used first.<br>
   You might want to use TurboPrint (latest version). AWeb will detect that
   TurboPrint is running, and <i>will</i> be able to print in more than
   256 colours.
   <p>
   <strong>Tip:</strong> Create a separate configuration (using the CONFIG
   <a HREF=../Working/startup.html>tooltype or argument</a>) with a 256 colour screen mode.
   When you like to print a page, first continue surfing, and after you have
   quit AWeb start it again with the other configuration. Now you can fetch
   the document from cache and print it off-line.
<p>
<li><em>AWeb doesn't display all of the page. Other browsers display the
   page correctly
   </em><br>
   Probably the page contains some erroneous HTML. One of the common errors
   is the use of bad comments as a divider line in the HTML source. In
   tolerant <a HREF=../Configuring/broptions.html#htmlmode>HTML mode</a>,
   AWeb tries to interpret the comment as it was probably meant by the
   author. In strict <a HREF=../Configuring/broptions.html#htmlmode>HTML mode</a>,
   large parts of the page may be commented out because of the bad syntax.<br>
   Try changing the <a HREF=../Configuring/broptions.html#htmlmode>HTML mode</a>
   to tolerant or compatible.
<p>
<li><em>AWeb becomes terribly slow if I run it on its own screen.
   </em><br>
   This has something to do with chip memory usage and DMA bandwidth.
   Apparently, the problem becomes worse when you have an accelerated
   machine.<br>
   The solution is to use either a lower or a higher speed ("baudrate") to communicate
   with your modem. Start at the modem speed (so if you own a 14k4 modem,
   start at 14k4 communication speed). Then increase the speed until you
   find a dramatic slowdown. Then go one step back.<br>
   Changing the communication speed with your modem might involve adapting
   the settings for your dialler, TCP stack and/or your SANA driver. Refer
   to the respective documentations.
<p>
<li><em>Backgrounds in AWeb are terribly slow, much slower than competitive
   Amiga browsers.
   </em><br>
   This might be caused by an unsuited picture datatype. Use the 24-bit
   picture datatype <strong>only</strong> on CyberGraphics screens; on
   original Amiga screens this datatype becomes very slow. Use the
   original picture.datatype from your Workbench diskette.
<p>
<li><em>The colour requester from the program settings: Palette page
   messes things up on a CyberGraphics screen.
   </em><br>
   This is caused by the palette-orientated design of the Amiga OS. This
   design works fine on Amiga chipset screens, but isn't really suited for
   graphics cards.
<p>
<li><em>I run AWeb on a small screen, and the save, use, test, cancel buttons
   in this settings window fall outside the screen.
   </em><br>
   Start the
   ClassAct preference program, or if you run AWeb under OS 3.5 or higher, the
   Reaction preference program, then go to the "Misc" page, and
   set "layout spacing" to a lower number.
<p>
<li><em>Closing the AWeb public screen while there is a visitor window open
   crashes if the screen is a CyberGraphics screen.
   </em><br>
   This is a bug in CyberGraphics V 2.15 and lower. The same thing happens on other
   CyberGraphics screens.
<p>
<li><em>If the window is not active, a click in the scroller container
   (outside the knob) moves the scroller but doesn't scroll the window
   contents.
   </em><br>
   This is a bug in Intuition. The same thing happens sometimes with
   MultiView.
<p>
<li><em>I use MagicMenu, and every now and then my system hangs if I open
   a menu.
   </em><br>
   With Magic Menu version 2.15 or higher this problem should be gone.
<p>
<li><em>I don't use MagicMenu, but my system hangs if I click on the wide
   part of the chooser gadget in the settings window.
   </em><br>
   Be sure to use the version of <code>chooser.gadget</code> included in
   this archive.<br>
   Also, some animated mouse pointer commodities are known to cause this
   hang.
