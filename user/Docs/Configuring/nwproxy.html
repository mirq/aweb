<H2>Proxy servers</H2>

A proxy server is a special server that acts as a gateway between your computer and the Internet.  Instead of having to establish a connection to a server possibly on the other end of the world, a browser only connects to the proxy.  The proxy server has a cache of the most popular pages, so there is a chance the page you requested is already there.  If not, the proxy server retrieves the document for you.  This will decrease the traffic on the network, thus speeding up websurfing.
<P>Sometimes a proxy server is the <EM>only</EM> way to connect via your Internet Service Provider, thereby acting as a firewall.

<H2>Configuring a proxy</H2>

First, choose the protocol you want to define the proxy for.  Use the chooser for this, it has 4 options:

<UL>
<LI>HTTP</LI>
<LI>FTP</LI>
<LI>Gopher</LI>
<LI>Telnet</LI>
</UL>

Then type in the address of the proxy in the <em>proxy</em> field.  Make sure it is in one of these two forms:
<PRE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://proxy.foo.bar</B></PRE>
<PRE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://proxy.foo.bar:8080</B></PRE>
<BR>where the name and port number may differ, of course.
<P>If the address doesn't start with "<CODE>htt..</CODE>", AWeb will prepend this to the address.

<H2>Limited proxy usage</H2>

Some proxies can't handle submitting forms with <CODE>METHOD=POST</CODE> or <A HREF="../Working/authorize.html">authorized</A> pages correctly.  If you have problems with such pages, try selecting this checkbox.  It allows AWeb send these pages directly to the server and not via the proxy.

<H2><A NAME="passiveftp">Passive FTP</A></H2>

If you are working from behind a firewall and you experience problems using FTP, try selecting this checkbox.  It tells AWeb to use a different way of making the necessary FTP connections that will more likely work from behind a firewall.

<H2>No proxy for these sites</H2>

If this list contains <EM>site names</EM> (also known as <EM>locations</EM> or <EM>host names</EM>), then documents and images from these sites will never be retrieved through the proxy.
<P>Use the <B>Add</B> button to add a new entry, and the <B>Del</B> button to delete the currently selected entry.  Double-click on an entry to edit the name <EM>in place</EM>.
<P>You may type simple host names, or use pattern matching.  If a string contains pattern matching characters, it's matched against the full url, not only the host name.  This enables you to selectively use the proxy for files from a server.
