<H1>&nbsp; About MIME types</H1>

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a mechanism for specifying and describing the format of Internet message bodies.  It was primarily designed for e-mail, but MIME types are used also to identify the type of data in the HTTP protocol, the most widely used protocol on the World Wide Web.
<P>For a browser like AWeb, the MIME type of a document determines whether the file should be displayed in the browser window, or be processed by some other program.
<P>A MIME type consists of a <EM>type</EM> and a <EM>subtype</EM>.  The <EM>type</EM> describes the major class of data, like text or image.  The <EM>subtype</EM> is used for a subdivision of the major type into different formats, like GIF or JPEG images.
<P> According to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1521.txt" TARGET="_blank">RFC 1521</A>, the following official MIME types are defined:

<DL>
<DT><B>TEXT/HTML</B><DD>This is a document in the HTML hypertext format. Virtually all pages on the Web are in this format.
<P><DT><B>TEXT/PLAIN</B><DD>This type is used for plain text documents (normally in ASCII).
<P><DT><B>APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM</B><DD>This describes a binary file. The file could be processed by some application.  An example of this would be an LHA archive.
<P><DT><B>APPLICATION/POSTSCRIPT</B><DD>The document is in PostScript format.
<P><DT><B>IMAGE/GIF</B><DT><B>IMAGE/JPEG</B><DD>These are images, in GIF and JPEG format.
<P><DT><B>AUDIO/BASIC</B><DD>This type is used for audio data encoded using 8-bit ISDN mu-law [PCM].
<P><DT><B>VIDEO/MPEG</B><DD>This is an animation in MPEG format.
</DL>

In addition to these (and other) official types and subtypes, it is possible to define extension MIME types and subtypes.  These should be prepended with &quot;<B>X-</B>&quot; to avoid collisions with future official MIME types.
