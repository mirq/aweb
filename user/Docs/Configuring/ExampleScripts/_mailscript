; Sample script to use your editor and mail post program
; to send mail from within AWeb for a mailto: address
; To use this script, configure AWeb to use for its Mailto: program
;    command = (path)/_mailscript
;  arguments = %s
;
; Make sure to change all path names, program names, etc. in this script
; to the ones you're actually using.

; Generate To: and Subject: headers

echo >T:AWeb.mailto.msg.{$$} "To: {TOADDRESS}*NSubject: *N"

; Append signature (change $HOME/.signature to the path and filename
; where your signature resides).

type >>T:AWeb.mailto.msg.{$$} $HOME/.signature

; Call editor (make sure it's in your path). In case you use CygnusED:
; do not follow more than one mailto: link at the same time. CED has a bug
; that may prevent this script from calling sendmail (IO is not returned for
; last message if more than one message is edited on the same screen).
; Commodore's ED and other editors do not have this problem.
;
; Change this line to call your favourite editor. E.g. if you want to
; use CygnusEd, you will change this line to:
;  CED T:AWeb.mailto.msg.{$$} -keepio ; CygnusED V2
; or
;  CED -s T:AWeb.mailto.msg.{$$}      ; CygnusED V3.5

ED T:AWeb.mailto.msg.{$$}

; Send the mail with a mail delivery program, like SMTPpost, or UUCP's
; sendmail. Make sure it is in your path, or else include the full
; path in the command.
; Change this line to use your mail delivery program. Refer to that
; program's documentation for the exact options to use.
