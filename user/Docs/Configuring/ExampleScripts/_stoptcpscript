; Sample script to stop a TCP program that was started using the
; _starttcpscript script
;
; To use this script, configure AWeb to use for its Stop TCP program:
;    command = (path)/_stoptcpscript
;  arguments = (none)

; The variable TCPPROCESS contains the CLI process that the TCP stack
; is running in.

Break $TCPPROCESS

; Note:
; If your TCP stack supports ARexx, you could use it to stop your TCP
; program directly, instead of using this script.
; In that case you should configure AWeb to use the following as its
; Stop TCP program:
;    command = SYS:RexxC:rx
;  arguments = "ADDRESS (portname) QUIT"
; where (portname) is the actual ARexx port name of your TCP program.
