<h1>&nbsp; Execute shell commands
and ARexx macros</h1>

AWeb offers a unique and powerful facility to execute Amiga DOS Shell
commands and ARexx macros
from a page, just by clicking on a hyperlink or by submitting
a form. With some effort, you can create complex applications using
AWeb as the user interface, starting scripts that dynamically compose
new documents that are loaded into AWeb via
<a href=ARexx/arexx.html>ARexx</a>, etcetera.
<p>
Although this feature can be very useful, it could also be very dangerous.
Therefore this feature works only from local pages (with a URL starting
with <code>file://localhost/</code>), and only if the
<a href=../Configuring/proptions.html#shellcmd>Allow Shell commands</a> setting
is selected. If you haven't selected this setting, a warning requester is
displayed whenever you try to follow such a hyperlink. In this requester you can
abandon the command, or allow it to continue.

<h2>Simple shell commands</h2>
To include a simple command, just add a normal hyperlink in your document
that points to a URL of the form
<pre>
   x-aweb:command/<i>your_DOS_command</i>

</pre>If the user clicks on the hyperlink, <i>your_DOS_command</i> is
executed. The output of the command is directed to an auto opening console
window, unless you specify another output redirection in your command.
<p>
Because <a href=htmlmode.html#compatible>compatible HTML mode</a> stops the
URL at a space, make sure you have escaped all spaces in the command
by "<code><b>&amp;#32;</b></code>" or else the command won't work if the
user has selected compatible HTML mode.
<p>
Example:
<code>&lt;a href="x-aweb:command/dir&amp;#32;sys:&amp;#32;all"&gt;get dir&lt;/a&gt;</code>
would allow the user to execute the <code>dir&nbsp;sys:&nbsp;all</code>
command by a click on the words "<code>get dir</code>".
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The DOS command is executed in a separate shell,
with a current directory set equal to the current directory of AWeb. You
are advised to use only absolute path names in the DOS command, or else
the result will depend on which directory happened to be the current
directory when you started AWeb. When AWeb is running, you can use the
assign name <code>AWebPath:</code> as an absolute reference to the
directory where the AWeb executable is located.

<h2>ARexx macros</h2>
Starting ARexx macros from your page works in a similar way. Just add a
normal hyperlink that points to a URL of the form
<pre>
   x-aweb:rexx/<i>your_ARexx_macro</i>

</pre>If the user clicks on the hyperlink, <i>your_ARexx_macro</i> is
started with the ARexx port for this window as the default command port.

<h2>Parameters</h2>
You can use a HTML <em>form</em> or a <em>clickable map</em> to pass
parameters to your DOS command or ARexx macro.

<h3>Forms</h3>
Supply a <code>ACTION="x-aweb:command/<i>your_command</i>"</code>
attribute in your <code>&lt;FORM&gt;</code> tag to execute the command
if the user submits the form. Similarly, you can include a
<code>ACTION="x-aweb:rexx/<i>your_macro</i>"</code> attribute to start
the ARexx macro.

<h4>METHOD=GET</h4>
For forms defined with <code>METHOD=GET</code> (the default), form
parameters are converted to Amiga DOS style parameters: the field
name will be used as the argument name, and the field value will be
used as argument value. The value will be quoted, with the <em>escape</em>,
<em>newline</em> and <em>quote</em> characters in the value escaped as
required by Amiga DOS.
<p>
Note: <em>switch arguments</em> (/S) cannot be passed in this way. You
could use a script instead, like the example below.
<p>
Parameters for ARexx macros are passed in the same format as for DOS
scripts. The argument string will contain the name, an equal sign, and
a quoted value for each form parameter. Have a look at the second
example below for one possible way of parsing this.
<p>
Note that the total length of all arguments passed in this way is
limited to about 4000 characters. The excess is truncated. If your
form might yield a longer argument set, use METHOD=POST instead.

<h4>METHOD=POST</h4>
For forms defined with <code>METHOD=POST</code>, a temporary file is
created. The command or ARexx script will be called with exactly one
argument, the file name. The temporary file contains the message in
exactly the same way as it would have been sent to a HTTP server.
In short, this means:<ul>
<li>Fields are separated by the <code>&amp;</code> character.
<li>Spaces are replaced by <code>+</code> characters.
<li>Most non-alphanumerical characters are replaced by a <code>%XX</code> sequence,
   where <code>XX</code> is the hexadecimal representation of the character.
</ul>
It is the responsibility of the command or script to delete the
temporary file afterwards.
<p>
Note that you should use the default form encoding
(<code>ENCTYPE="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</code>, or don't specify
the <code>ENCTYPE</code> attribute). The <code>multipart/form-data</code>
encoding type is not supported for Shell and ARexx forms.<br>
For file upload fields (<code>&lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE&gt;</code>) the file
<em>name</em> is included in the message when using default encoding, not
the file <em>contents</em> as it would for <code>multipart/form-data</code>
forms. This is probably what you want in your command or script.

<h3>Clickable maps</h3>
When using a clickable map, the x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer
within the image are passed to the command as parameters without keyword.

<h2>Load the result back into AWeb</h2>
If your script or macro has created an HTML document (or just a plain
text file), you can automatically load this file back into AWeb. Use the
ARexx <a href="ARexx/window.html#OPEN"><code>OPEN</code></a> command for
this purpose. If you re-use the name of your file for different responses,
be sure to add the <code>RELOAD</code> switch to prevent AWeb from showing
the previous (cached) document again.
<p>
Of course, this will work better from within an ARexx macro than from
within a DOS script. In a DOS script, you have no way of determining to
which ARexx port you should address the <code>OPEN</code> command.
<p>
Another way is to load the resulting document directly into AWeb while
you are creating it, without the need to create a temporary file. Look
at the description of the
<a href="ARexx/window.html#CHANOPEN"><code>CHANOPEN</code></a> command
for details.

<h2>Examples</h2>
Below are two examples of this feature. Have a look
at the source of this page, and at the executed
<a href=ExampleScripts/_getdir.rexx>macro</a>
first to convince yourself that following the link or
submitting the form won't do any harm.
Then select <a href=../Configuring/proptions.html#shellcmd>Allow Shell commands</a>
in the program settings requester and play with this form.

<h3>Simple shell command</h3>
This example just gets the directory of SYS: and shows it in a separate
console window: <a href="x-aweb:command/dir&#32;SYS:">show dir</a>.

<h3>ARexx macro</h3>
This example gets the directory contents of a selected drawer.
<p>
<form action="x-aweb:rexx/AWebPath:Docs/Advanced/ExampleScripts/_getdir.rexx">
Drawer:
<select name=drawer>
<option value=''>(current)
<option>Docs
<option>Icons
<option>Classes
</select>
<p>
<input type=checkbox name=dirsopt value=dirs> Show only directories, not files
<p>
<input type=checkbox name=allopt value=all> Walk through subdirectories
<p>
<input type=submit value="OK">
</form>
