<h1>&nbsp; Programming in JavaScript</h1>

<h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
An overview of JavaScript falls outside the scope of this manual. For more
information, search the web for an explanatory page you like, or look at NetScape's
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/" TARGET="_blank">
JavaScript 1.1</A> guide.

<h2><a name=AWebJS>AWebJS</a></h2>
AWebJS is a standalone JavaScript interpreter, to facilitate testing of your
JavaScript programs that doesn't rely on browser objects.

<h3>Starting from the shell</h3>
You can run AWebJS only from the Shell (or CLI).
<dl>
<dt>Format:
<dd><code><b>AWebJS <i>filename</i>... [ PUBSCREEN <i>public_screen_name</i> ]
   [ DEBUG ]</b></code>
<p>
<dt>Template:
<dd><code><b>FILES/M/A,PUBSCREEN/K,DEBUG/S</b></code>
</dl>
The files in the FILES argument are executed in the given order, using
a shared variable space. That is, global variables and functions defined in one
file are still available in later files (during the same invocation of AWebJS).
<p>
The screen name in the PUBSCREEN argument is used to open any error requesters on,
and the <a href=#debugger>debugger</a> window. By default these windows are
opened on the default public screen.
<p>
If you set the DEBUG switch, the <a href=#debugger>debugger</a> is started
when executing each file.

<h3>Special functions</h3>
When a program is run using AWebJS, the browser objects like <code>document</code>
and <code>window</code> are not available. Because it wouldn't make much sense
to run a program without any input or output facilities, AWebJS defines a couple
of predefined I/O functions.

<h4>write, writeln</h4>
Writes one or more expressions to the standard output stream (the Shell window).

<h5>Syntax</h5>
<pre>
write(<i>expression1</i> [,<i>expression2</i>], ...[,<i>expressionN</i>])
writeln(<i>expression1</i> [,<i>expression2</i>], ...[,<i>expressionN</i>])
</pre>

<h5>Parameters</h5>
<i>expression1</i> through <i>expressionN</i> are any JavaScript expressions.

<h5>Description</h5>
The <code>write</code> function converts each expression to string, and outputs
the result to the standard output stream. Usually this will be the shell
window, unless you have redirected the output of AWebJS.
<p>
The <code>writeln</code> function does the same as the <code>write</code>
function, but adds a newline after the last expression.
<p>
When you want to include your JavaScript program in an HTML document, you'll
have to use <code>document.write</code> instead of just <code>write</code>.
To avoid the need of changing your program again after you've completed
testing with AWebJS, use the following code fragment:
<p>
<pre>
function Document()
{  this.write=write;
   this.writeln=writeln;
}

var document=new Document();

</pre>

Add these lines to the start of your program (and remove them before including
the JavaScript program in your HTML document). Or save these lines in a separate
file and specify the file as the first FILES argument on the AWebJS call.
<p>
By using this code fragment, you can use <code>document.write</code> and
<code>document.writeln</code> in your JavaScript program even when testing
with AWebJS.

<h4>readln</h5>
Reads a line from the standard input stream (the Shell window).

<h5>Syntax</h5>
<pre>
readln()
</pre>

<h5>Description</h5>
The <code>readln</code> function reads a line from the standard input
stream and returns it as a string value. Usually the standard input stream
will be the shell window, unless you have redirected the input of AWebJS.
<p>
The string returned has a maximum length of 80 characters.


<h2><a name=debugger>JavaScript debugger</a></h2>
The built-in JavaScript debugger facilitates in adding JavaScript functions
to your own HTML pages. You can step through any script, and investigate variable
values.

<h3>Invocation</h3>
You can invoke the debugger in two ways:
<p>
To start the debugger with every piece of JavaScript executed, you check the
<code>Control / Debug&nbsp;JavaScript</code> menu option.
<p>
Alternatively, you can select the <code>Debug</code> button from a run-time
JavaScript error requester to invoke the debugger.

<h3>Functions</h3>
When the debugger is active, the program is executed step by step. You can
control how big these steps are.
<p>
In the top region of the debugger window, the current line number and the
<em>current code fragment</em> is shown. "Code fragment" can be anything:
a statement, a partial expression, or even an entire function. Note the
code shown here is a result of decompilation, so it may look a bit different
from the actual source code.
<p>
You control what is done next by clicking one button in the button row.

<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Over
   <td>Step over the current fragment.<br>
      The current fragment is executed, and execution is halted again afterwards.

<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Into
   <td>Step into the current fragment.<br>
      The first part of the current fragment is made the new current fragment.
      For example, if the current fragment is a compound statement (between braces,
      {...}), the first contained statement will become the next current fragment.
      If the current
      fragment is an assignment statement, the operand on the left-hand side
      of the assignment operator is made the next current fragment.
      <p>
      Note: If the current fragment is atomic (like a number, or an identifier),
      execution is advanced one step.

<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Test
   <td>Test the current fragment.<br>
      The current fragment is executed, but execution is not advanced. The result
      of the current fragment is shown in the result field at the bottom of the
      debugger window.
      <p>
      Note: <b>this function has side effects!</b> If the value of a variable
      is changed in the current fragment (like the = or the ++ operators), this
      change is permanent.

<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Dump
   <td>Dump all variables.<br>
      A <a href="#dump">variable dump</a>, listing all variables and objects,
      is written to a file.

<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Run
   <td>Run the program.<br>
      The debugger window is closed, and execution is resumed without further
      interruption.

<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Stop
   <td>Stop the program.<br>
      The debugger window is closed and execution is cancelled.
</table>

Below the button row is a text entry field labelled <em>Expression</em>. You can
type any expression in this field. When you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> the expression
is evaluated and the result is shown in the result field at the bottom of the
window. Note: <b>this function has side effects!</b> If the value of a variable
is changed in the current fragment (like the = or the ++ operators), this
change is permanent.

<h3><a name=dump>Variable dump</a></h3>
The <b>Dump</b> function of the debugger writes a listing of all variables
and objects into a file. A file requester is opened to let you select the
path and file name for the dump.
<p>
Suppose the following script:
<pre>

    1 function Foo(a,b)
    2 {
    3    var i=2*a+b+bar;
    4    return i;
    5 }
    6
    7 var bar=77;
    8 var x=Foo(17,8);

</pre>
was run in AWebJS until line 4 and then a dump was made. The dump would look like this:
<pre>

    1 ---------------------------------------------------
    2 Function call stack
    3 ---------------------------------------------------
    4
    5 In function 'Foo'
    6     a           [N]=17
    7     arguments   [O]=(see #1) object 'Array'
    8                     17,8
    9     b           [N]=8
   10     caller      [O]=null
   11     Foo         [O]=(see #2) function 'Foo'
   12     i           [N]=119
   13     + global variables (see #3)
   14
   15 In program
   16     + global variables (see #3)

   27     arguments   [O]=(see #1) object 'Array'
   28                     17,8
   29     prototype   [O]=object 'Foo'
   30
   31   3 -- Object
   32     bar         [N]=77
   33     Foo         [O]=(see #2) function 'Foo'
   34     x           [?]=undefined

</pre>
Notes:
<dl>
<dt>Line 1-17
<dd>The first part lists all nested functions that were called before the
current execution point was reached.

<dt>Line 5-13
<dd>A function entry appears for each function in the call stack. Below the
function name the local variables are listed.

<dt>Line 6
<dd>The local variable <code>a</code> has a numeric value of 17. The letter
between brackets indicates the value type:
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td><code> [N] </code><td>Numeric
<tr><td><code> [S] </code><td>String
<tr><td><code> [B] </code><td>Boolean
<tr><td><code> [O] </code><td>Object or Function
<tr><td><code> [?] </code><td>undefined
</table>

<dt>Line 7,8
<dd>The local variable <code>arguments</code> (defined automatically by JavaScript)
is an object of type 'Array', and has the value <code>17,8</code>.
The <code>(See&nbsp;#1)</code> note refers to the second part (line 22),
where the object is broken down further.

<dt>Line 13
<dd>The global variables for this function are listed in the second part
under number 3.

<dt>Line 15,16
<dd>The last entry in the first part is that for the program itself. The
global variables are defined in object number 3.

<dt>Line 18-34
<dd>The second part lists all objects referenced in both parts of the
listing.

<dt>Line 22-24
<dd>Object number 1 lists the object of type 'Array' that was referenced from
line 7. Its individual properties are listed.

<dt>Line 26-29
<dd>Functions are a JavaScript object, too.

<dt>Line 31-34
<dd>The object holding the global variables for this program.
