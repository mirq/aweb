<h1>&nbsp; HTML modes</h1>

<h2>About HTML</h2>
Most of the documents ("pages") found on the World Wide Web are written
in <em>HTML</em> (HyperText Markup Language). HTML was originally designed
as a standard
hard- and software independent way of formatting documents. It is an
application of <em>SGML</em> (Standard Generalized Markup Language).
<p>
The only official standard is HTML 2.0, which contains very limited
possibilities. The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/" TARGET="_blank">W3 consortium</A> was
developing a new, extended standard, HTML 3.0.
<p>
Meanwhile, in the recent boom of Internet and the World Wide Web, some browser
manufacturers have introduced several ad-hoc extensions to HTML, of which
many didn't fit in the new HTML 3.0 standard. Probably because this would make
HTML 3.0 an academic standard without any practical use, the development of
HTML 3.0 was abandoned. AWeb supports some of the extensions found in HTML 3.0.
<p>
In the first half of 1996 the W3 group proposed a new HTML 3.2 standard, which contains many
of the widely used NetScape &reg; and Microsoft &reg; Internet Explorer specific
extensions. In 1997 its successor, HTML 4.0 is proposed.
AWeb fully supports HTML 3.2 and many features of HTML 4.0 (one major
exception being style sheets).
<p>
The large browser manufacturers have introduced other tags, that aren't
included in the HTML standard. AWeb will try to support most of these
non-standard extensions.
<p>
To make things even more inconvenient, some earlier versions of popular PC
browsers didn't stick to the SGML rules. And even recent versions of
those browsers still have problems with SGML comments. Because many
people design their pages using these browsers, there are many documents
on the web that just are bad HTML.

<h2>HTML modes</h2>
AWeb does its best to display all pages correctly, but sometimes you have
to set the way HTML should be interpreted to get the best results.
<p>
You can choose out of three <em>HTML modes</em>:
<table>
<tr valign=top><th align=left valign=top>Strict
   <td>In <em>strict</em> HTML mode, AWeb understands only the
   HTML standard.
<tr valign=top><th align=left valign=top>Tolerant
   <td>In <em>tolerant</em> HTML mode, AWeb understands also other extensions.
   These are both extensions specific to other browsers, and HTML 3.0
   extensions that can't be found in HTML 3.2 or HTML 4.0.<br>
   Also, some commonly made errors are correctly understood. See
   <a href=#tolerant>below</a> for a list of corrected errors.

<tr valign=top><th align=left valign=top>Compatible
   <td>In <em>compatible</em> HTML mode (a nice way of formulating "buggy"),
   AWeb tries to interpret buggy HTML. <a href=#compatible>Below</a> is
   a description of the deviations of the standard when compatibility mode
   is used.
</table>
Set one of these in the <a href=../Configuring/broptions.html#htmlmode>Options</a>
page in the browser settings.
<p>
The <a href=html.html>overview of supported HTML</a> mentions with each
HTML tag or attribute in which mode it is recognized.
<P><I>NOTE: Tolerant mode is the recommended mode to use on a regular basis.  Only use Compatible mode to view a website if Tolerant does not appear to work properly, otherwise undesirable results may occur.</I>

<h2><a name=tolerant>Tolerant mode</a></h2>
In tolerant mode, AWeb recovers from the following commonly made HTML errors:
<ul>
<li>Incorrectly placed tags in &lt;TABLE&gt;, like missing &lt;TD&gt;,
   or &lt;FORM&gt; between &lt;TABLE&gt; and the first &lt;TR&gt;.
<li>Invalid "<code>&amp;#nnn;</code>" entities, that contain a number that
   is not included in the HTML Coded Character set, are converted to
   whitespace.
<li>Many forms of incorrect comments. When AWeb encounters a comment, it
   starts by assuming the comment is correct, but if it encounters something
   that does not belong in a correct <a href=html-ad.html#comment>comment</a>,
   it terminates the comment at the first "&gt;".
   This catches most of the incorrect comment usage, but it is still
   possible that some of the HTML is inadvertently commented out.
<li>When an URL in a hyperlink contains whitespace (a common source of this
   whitespace is the HREF or SRC attribute being broken over two lines),
   this whitespace is removed.
<li>If a resulting absolute URL contains a path beginning with one or more
   "<code>../</code>", these are removed.
</ul>

<h2><a name=compatible>Compatible mode</a></h2>
As mentioned above, some pages contain bad HTML. When you view such a
page, it can look distorted. You can expect large parts of the page missing,
links to URLs that seem to contain HTML tags, and other strange things.
<p>
If you encounter such problems, try using the <em>compatible</em> HTML
mode of AWeb. <strong>Warning:</strong> Using compatible HTML mode,
documents containing <em>valid</em> HTML might look distorted in turn.
<p>
In compatible mode, AWeb exposes the following deviations from the
SGML and HTTP standards:
<ul>
<li>Quoted attribute values are terminated by any occurrence of "&gt;"
<li>Quoted attributes that contain URLs, like HREF, SRC and ACTION, are
   terminated by whitespace
<li>Comments are terminated by any occurrence of "-&gt;"
<li>When a server responds to a POST request with a HTTP redirection
   (status 301 or 302), the new location is accessed with the GET method
   instead of POST.
</ul>
