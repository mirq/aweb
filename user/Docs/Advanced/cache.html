<h1>&nbsp; Cache usage</h1>

<h2>Why a cache is useful</h2>
When you are web-surfing, you often find that there are pages that you
visit every time again. Most of the time these pages haven't changed, so
it is really a waste of network bandwidth to fetch the page (and possibly
the images on it) every time. The <em>cache</em> is used to store the most
recently visited
pages and images on your hard disk. The next time you visit the same page,
it is already on your computer. There is no need to retrieve it again
over the network, thus saving time and bandwidth.
<p>
Another benefit of having a cache is, that after you have disconnected
from the network, the pages remain on your computer. You can then browse
through them again <em>off-line</em>.

<h2>How the cache works</h2>
AWeb uses a two-stage caching system, both in memory and on disk. The
main cache is on disk, and for the most recently used objects there is
also a copy in memory. This way you will always get the maximum response
speed.<br>
<font size=-1>The term "object" is used here to indicate documents (pages)
and inlined images shown within documents.</font>
<p>
Whenever you click a link (or type an URL), or an embedded image on a
page is needed, AWeb first looks in its cache to see if it is already
there. If the object is in memory, it is used immediately. If it is
still on disk but not in memory, it is loaded back into memory. If it
is not on disk, it is fetched over the network.
<p>
A <em>reload</em> of an object never uses the cached copy, but fetches
the object from the original location again.

<h2><a name=verify>Verifications</a></h2>
There are two types of objects to consider for caching: Static objects and Dynamic objects.
<p>Static objects are simply items that don't change from moment to moment, although they may change over the long term as a website is updated.  An image or standard HTML page is an example of this.  Dynamic objects are those that are created "on the fly" or "on demand" by a server.  That is, content differs each time it is downloaded.  This is commonly performed via a PHP script, for example.
<p>There is no standard defined way to determine whether an object may be considered static or dynamic, but usually static objects have the "Last-Modified" HTTP header defined, so AWeb uses this to differentiate.

<p>If the original object has been updated since it was stored
in the cache, the cache copy should be updated as well. Therefore,
when AWeb uses a cached copy of an object, it also
sends a verification request to the server,
to see if the object was modified. If not, AWeb will use the cache copy,
and if the object <em>is</em> modified, AWeb will fetch the new version.
<p>
You can control how often AWeb will check with the server:

<h3>&middot; Verify always</h3>
<em>Every time</em> AWeb uses an object from the cache, it will also send
out a verification request. This guarantees that you always see the most
recent version. Obviously it also generates a lot of network activity,
so normally you won't use this. Only if you visit sites with many documents
that are updated very frequently you may want to use this option.

<h3>&middot; Verify once per session</h3>
Only when AWeb uses an object from the cache for the first time after you
started AWeb, it will check with the server. The second and later times the
object is used without verification. This allows AWeb to update its cached
objects regularly, but does not produce excessive network overhead. This is
the default verification mode.

<h3>&middot; Verify never</h3>
AWeb will just use cached copies of objects if they are available.
It will never check with the server if
the object has changed. If you know or suspect that the cached copy
is no longer up-to-date, you should use the reload function.
<p>
When you browse <em>off-line</em> through cached pages with AWeb set to one of
the other response modes, AWeb silently falls back to
<em>verify never</em> mode. So it won't complain that it cannot
connect to the server, and won't try to start your TCP stack just to
verify cached objects. Of course it <em>will</em> do so when you try
to fetch an object that is not in cache.

<h2><a name=fast>Fast response</a></h2>
Most browsers implement the verification mentioned above so that they first
ask the server, and when the object turns out to be unmodified, then they
use the cached copy. As a consequence, with <em>every</em> link you follow,
you have to wait a few seconds until the network connection is set up and
the server responds. You have to wait with every verification, even if the object is
still in cache and up-to-date.
<p>
In most cases, the cached copy <em>will</em> still be valid.
After all, that is one of the reasons for having a cache in the first place.
So slow verification will let you wait many times totally unnecessary.
<p>
When using <strong>fast response</strong> mode, AWeb <em>always</em> uses
the cached copy if one is available.
The cached document or image is displayed immediately.
In the same time that the object is displayed, AWeb connects to the server
and verifies if the object is indeed not modified.
In most cases the copy will still be up-to-date,
and these connections disappear silently after a few seconds. This way
you will gain a few seconds with every link you follow to a cached document.
<p>
In the few cases where the object was modified, you will first see the
old version that was in cache. Then after a few seconds, when the server
responds, the new updated
version will be shown in the window, much like as if you had hit the reload
button.
<p>If this behaviour confuses you or annoys you, you should not use fast response
mode.
<p>The recommended setting is to verify "Always" without Fast response for Dynamic objects, and verify "Once per session" with Fast response for Static objects.

<h2><a name=nocache>Uncached objects</a></h2>
All documents and inlined images <em>from the net</em> are stored in
the cache. The following objects will <em>not</em> go into the cache:
<ul>
<li>Objects from your own machine (<code>file://localhost</code>). Because these
   objects already reside on your harddisk, there is no reason to store them
   again in the cache.
<li>Downloaded objects, they are stored at the location where you save them.
<li>Objects from sites listed in the <a href=../Configuring/nwcache.html#nocache>do
   not cache these sites list</a>.
</ul>

<h2><a name=cachedir>Cache directory</a></h2>
To take maximum advantage of AWeb's cache, the
<a href=../Configuring/nwcache.html#cachedir>cache directory</a> should be
located on your hard disk. It is possible to configure AWeb to use a drawer
in your Ram disk for its cache,
but that would take up much memory and everything will be lost when you
turn off your machine.
<p>
Should your machine crash (or be turned off) while AWeb was still active,
then the next time you start AWeb the cache will be recovered
automatically.
<p>
AWeb stores its cache files in several subdirectories. That way the number
of files in each directory is kept low, which will result in a much faster
cache when used with certain file systems (like AFS).
<p>
Note that you should not use the cache directory for anything else. Also,
don't modify or delete any files.<br>
If you accidentally deleted some files
from the cache, or if you suspect that it has become corrupt, you
should use the <code>Cache / Fix&nbsp;cache...</code> menu item. It will
synchronize the internal registration with the files actually on disk.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This function will delete any files from the cache
directory that are not belonging to AWebs cache.

<h2>Cachebrowser</h2>
You can use the <a href=../Working/cachebrowser.html>cachebrowser</a> to see what files
are in the cache, and optionally view, save or delete them.
