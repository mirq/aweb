<h1>&nbsp; Plugin API</h1>

AWeb can handle many types of files internally, or with the use of datatypes.
The operation of AWeb may be extended by use of external plugin modules.
Such a plugin module would handle files that AWeb can't handle itself, or
it would offer more functionality than AWeb does.
<p>
Plugin modules must not be confused with external ARexx scripts, historically
also called "plugins". A plugin module is a shared library with a specific
interface. Plugin modules are allowed to render directly into the AWeb window,
either as a standalone object, or as an embedded object in a HTML document.
<p>
The API (Application Programmers Interface) is freely available from
<A HREF="http://aweb.sunsite.dk" TARGET="_blank">The Official AWeb Open Source Project website</A>.
The archive contains all documentation, C header files, and an example
plugin module with source (written in C).
