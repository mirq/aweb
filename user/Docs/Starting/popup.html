<h1>&nbsp; The popup menu</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Given a link, an image or a frame,
there are a number of things you might like to
do with it. You might want to follow a link, download it, open it in a
new window, load or flush an image, etc.
The <em>popup menu</em> offers a way to choose from all these different
functions in a clear and easy fashion.
<p>
Furthermore, you can <a HREF=../Configuring/uipopup.html>configure</a> the
choices in the popup menu yourself the way they fit your needs best.

<h2>Using the popup menu</h2>
To open the popup menu, hold the <kbd>ALT</kbd> or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and click on a link
or an image. Or, you can click on a link or an image using the middle mouse button
if you own a three-button mouse.
The menu opens and presents you a list of choices depending
on the type of object you clicked on. Then you can click on the desired function.
<p>
To open the popup menu for a frame, just click in the same fashion anywhere in
the frame, outside a link or foreground image. (Clicking on a link or image would
present the popup menu for that object.)
<p>
You can <a HREF=../Configuring/uioptions.html#popup>configure</a> AWeb to open the
popup menu also if you use the right mouse button, or when
you hold down the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key, or not to open
the popup menu if you hold down the <kbd>ALT</kbd> or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>key.
<p>
To close the menu without choosing a function, you can click the right mouse
button, or click anywhere outside the popup menu.

<h2>Image functions</h2>
If you opened the popup menu for an <em>image</em>,
by default
it can contain the following functions as long as they are applicable:
<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Load image
   <td>Load the image, just like if you had clicked on the image.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Flush image
   <td>Flush this image from memory.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Reload image
   <td>Reload this image.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Save image
   <td>This will save the image, just like if you had shift-clicked on the image.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Download image
   <td>This will download the image, just like if you had shift-clicked
      on the unloaded-image icon.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Show image
   <td>This function shows the image using the
      <a HREF=../Configuring/brviewers.html>external viewer</a> for this
      image type.
</table>

<h2>Link functions</h2>
If you opened the popup menu for a <em>link</em>,
by default
it can contain the following functions as long as they are applicable:
<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Open link
   <td>This will show the document behind the link in the current window,
      just like if you had clicked on the link.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Open link in new window
   <td>Open a new window, and display the document in the new window.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Load link in background
   <td>This function retrieves the document, but doesn't display it in
      any window. You will use this function to load a page into the
      <a HREF=../Advanced/cache.html>cache</a>, to view it later.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Save link
   <td>Save the document behind this link to disk, just like if you had
      shift-clicked on the link.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Download link
   <td>Download the document behind this link and saves it to disk, just
      like if you had shift-clicked on the link.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Add link to hotlist
   <td>This adds an entry to the <a HREF=../Working/hotlist.html>hotlist</a> for the
      URL this link points to.
</table>
<p>
If you open the popup menu for an image that is also a link, the popup menu will
contain both sets of functions.

<h2>Frame functions</h2>
If you opened the popup menu for a <em>frame</em>, by default
it contains the following functions:
<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Reload contents
   <td>Reload the contents of the frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Save source
   <td>Save the source of the file currently displayed in the frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>View source
   <td>Start the HTML viewer to show the HTML source of the file displayed in the frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Show separately
   <td>Show the current contents of the frame in the entire browser window,
      without usage of frames.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Search in contents
   <td>Start the <a HREF=../Working/search.html>search function</a> for the page displayed
      in the frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Info
   <td>Open the <a HREF=infowindow.html>information window</a> for the page displayed
      in the frame.
</table>
<p>
If the document shown in the frame has a background image, the popup menu will
contain the functions for that image and for the frame.
