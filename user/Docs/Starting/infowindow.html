<h1>&nbsp; Information window</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The information window shows miscellaneous details about the current document.

<h2>Opening the window</h2>
You can open the window by selecting the <code><b>Project / Info...</b></code>
menu item, or by selecting the <code><b>Info</b></code> item from the default
frame <a href=popup.html>popup menu</a>.

<h2>Contents of the window</h2>
The information window shows the url of the current document, and a list with
details about this document. The list contains the following sections:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Read from AWeb cache</b>
<dd>This line is included if the document was read from the AWeb
<a href=../Advanced/cache.html>cache</a>, not directly from the network.
<p>
<dt><b>SSL library used</b>
<dd>This line contains the ID string of the SSL library used if the document
was retrieved over a <a href="../Working/secure.html">secure connection</a>.
<p>
<dt><b>HTTPS cipher method</b>
<dd>This line contains the cipher (encryption) method used if the document
was retrieved over a <a href="../Working/secure.html">secure connection</a>.
<p>
<dt><b>Transfer headers</b>
<dd>This section lists all the HTTP transfer headers as they were sent by
the server.
<p>
If the document was read from the AWeb cache, the header information as it
was reconstructed by the cache is shown, not the original HTTP headers.
<p>
<dt><b>Meta information</b>
<dd>This section contains information from &lt;META&gt; tags in the document.
These details are purely informational.
<p>
<dt><b>Clickable links</b>
<dd>This section contains clickable entries. Each entry corresponds with
a &lt;LINK&gt; tag in the document. Clicking an entry will generally load
another document.
