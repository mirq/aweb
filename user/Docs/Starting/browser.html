<h1>&nbsp; The browser window</h1>

The browser window is the most important window of AWeb. It is the place
where World Wide Web pages are displayed. On top of the window there are
some <a href=../Starting/gui.html>gadgets</a>.

<h2><a name=scroll>Scrolling the page</a></h2>
You can scroll the window contents horizontally and vertically, provided
the size of the document is larger than the window.
<p>
Of course you can use the scroll bars and arrow buttons to scroll, but AWeb
also understands the following keys:
<ul>
<li><kbd><b>cursor up/down</b></kbd> (both cursor keypad and numeric
   keypad) scroll up and down over a short distance.
<li><kbd><b>shift + cursor up/down</b></kbd> (cursor keypad) scroll up or
   down a page.
<li><kbd><b>PgUp, PgDn</b></kbd> (numeric keypad) scroll up or down a page.
<li><kbd><b>Space, Backspace</b></kbd> scroll up or down a page.
<li><kbd><b>Home, End</b></kbd> (numeric keypad) jump to the beginning or
   the end of the document.
<li><kbd><b>cursor left/right</b></kbd> (both cursor keypad and numeric
   keypad) scroll left and right. This is only possible if the document
   contains an image or preformatted text wider than the window, because
   otherwise AWeb will keep the text formatted to fit within the window
   width.
<li><kbd><b>shift + cursor left/right</b></kbd> (cursor keypad) scroll
   left or right a full page width.
</ul>
Note: these are the default keys, you can <a HREF=../Configuring/uikeys.html>configure
</a> different keys, or different actions for these keys.

<h2><a name=frames>Frames</a></h2>
Many pages on the World Wide Web use a feature called <em>frames</em>.
Effectively frames are a subdivision of the browser window, to allow the
display of several different documents simultaneously. When frames are
displayed, the main window scroll bars are probably set to full-size
(not scrollable). Instead, some frames may contain a scroll bar you can
use to scroll the frame contents.
<p>
In many framed pages, one frame contains the main document, and other,
smaller, frames contain additional things like a banner or a navigation
bar. In such cases, AWeb will make a reasonable guess of what frame would
be a likely candidate for scrolling.
In this frame, you can scroll with the same keys as
explained <a href=#scroll>above</a>. If you want to scroll another frame
than the one AWeb selected, you just have to click in it once (or use
its scrollers), and that frame will be selected for subsequent scrolling
with the keyboard.
<p>
Sometimes the Web page author defines frames explicitly without scrollers,
even if the contents is larger than the visible portion. Although there
are no scrollers, you can still scroll such a frame with the keyboard.
<p>
Frames have their own <a href=../Starting/popup.html>popup menu</a>. It is selectable
in the top left corner of each frame.
<p>
You can always resize frames. Just grab the edge of a frame with the mouse
and move it until the desired size is reached. Use the <code>Control /
Reset&nbsp;frames</code> menu item to reset all frames to their initial
size.
<p>
On small windows (like those on 200 or 256 high screens) a framed page
often appears squeezed, and is not easy to use. In that case you can
<a HREF="../Configuring/broptions.html#nominal">configure</a> AWeb to use a larger
height to layout the page against. Then you can use the window scrollbar
to scroll the framed page in its entirety.

<h2><a name=links>Following links</a></h2>
One of the most important features of the World Wide Web is the ability
to include <em>hyperlinks</em> in documents. A hyperlink is displayed in
another colour, and by default underlined. You can change the colour and
the underlining in the <a HREF=../Configuring/broptions.html>Options</a> page
in the browser settings requester.
<p>
Images that are also links have a frame drawn around them. If you have
deselected the link underlining in the
<a HREF=../Configuring/broptions.html>browser settings</a> requester, then this frame isn't
drawn.
<p>
Click the text or image to follow the link, i.e. retrieve and display the
document "behind" the link. The URL (network address) of the document
that is linked to, is shown in the status indicator
when the mouse pointer is over the hyperlink.

<h2><a name=ftp>FTP links</a></h2>
Sometimes a hyperlink doesn't point to another document, but to a file
or directory via FTP instead. You can recognize such hyperlinks by their
URL (network address), that starts with "<code>ftp://</code>". If you
click on a FTP link to a directory, AWeb will show the contents of this
directory. There is no standardized format for this, but usually you will
see the names of files or subdirectories on the right-hand side of the
listing. These are made hyperlinks again, so you can browse through a
directory structure by clicking the links. Often the listing also contains
file sizes and dates.
<p>
If you click on a link to a file, AWeb will load the file and display it
if the file is displayable. If the file cannot be displayed, a file requester
will pop up to let you save the file.
<p>
If you browse from behind a firewall, the firewall might not allow the FTP
connection the normal way. You can
<a HREF=../Configuring/nwproxy.html#passiveftp>configure</a> AWeb to use a different
way of establishing the FTP connection that is likely to work from behind
a firewall.

<h2><a name=stimages>Standalone images</a></h2>
Sometimes a hyperlink does not point to another document, but to an image
instead. By default these images are displayed in the AWeb browser window.
You can, however, <a HREF=../Configuring/prprograms.html#imgviewer>configure</a> an
external image viewer that will be used to show these images.
<p>
Note that when the image linked to is already in AWeb's memory, the external
viewer is not used. This may be the case if the link points to exactly
the same image as appears in a document. Since the image is already
decoded and in memory, it would be a waste of resources to let it decode
again and take up more memory by an external viewer. If you like to
view the image in the external viewer, you have to flush the image
from AWeb's memory first. One way of flushing an image is by using the
<a href=#popup>popup menu</a>.

<h2><a name=images>Inlined images</a></h2>
A document can contain inlined images interspersed with the text. If an
inlined image is not (yet) loaded, AWeb displays an icon for that image.
You can select if you want images to be loaded immediately or not using the
<a HREF=../Configuring/nwoptions.html#imgload>image loading</a> chooser in the
settings requester.
<p>
AWeb displays different icons under different circumstances.
You can tell AWeb to use <a HREF="../Configuring/images.html">your own images</a> here.
<p>
<img src="x-nil:no-image-here" align=left hspace=2> This icon depicts an unloaded image.
Click it to load the image.
<br clear=all><br>
<a href="x-nil:no-link-here"><img src="x-nil:no-image-here" align=left hspace=2></a>
If an unloaded image
is also a link to another document, there is a diagonal line through the image.
Click in the upper left half
of the icon to follow the link directly, or in the bottom right half to
load the image.
<br clear=all><br>
<a href="x-nil:no-link-here"><img src="x-nil:no-image-here" ismap align=left hspace=2></a>
This icon depicts an unloaded clickable map. Because a clickable map is always
also a link to another document, the diagonal line is here too. Click on the bottom
right half to load the image. Once it is loaded you can pick a spot from the map.<br>
You can click in the upper left half of the icon to follow the link without
map coordinates. Servers should recognize this as a request to a text-only
version of the page.
<br clear=all><br>
<img src="/PROGDIR:Images/def_errimage" align=left hspace=2>
If an image cannot be loaded for some reason, this icon is shown.
<br clear=all><br>
For an inlined image, a so-called ALT-text can be defined. This is a text
that can be displayed if the browser doesn't display the image. Of course,
AWeb understands this ALT-text and will display it instead of the icon
imagery. With ALT-text, unloaded images look like this:
<br clear=all><br>
<img src="x-nil:no-image-here" alt="ALT-text" align=left> Unloaded image.
<br clear=all><br>
<a href="x-nil:no-link-here"><img src="x-nil:no-image-here" alt="ALT-text" align=left></a>
Unloaded image that is also a link or a clickable map.
<br clear=all>

<h2>Downloading</h2>
Instead of following a link and display the new document, or loading
and displaying an inlined image, you can <em>download</em> a document
or an inlined image. To do so, hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while
clicking the link or image icon. The document or image is retrieved, and a
standard save requester will pop up to let you specify a file name.
<p>
If the document or image is already in <a HREF=../Advanced/cache.html>cache</a>, it
will only be saved, not retrieved again over the network.
<p>
Note you can also save a displayed image in this way. Just press the
<kbd>Shift</kbd> key and click the image. This will work even for background
images (only if background images are displayed):
just shift-click somewhere in the background and you will be asked
for a filename to save the background image.
<p>
If the image is also a link, shift-clicking the image
could be ambiguous; therefore AWeb will save the image in this case.
If you want to download the document "behind" the link, you should use
the <a href=../Starting/popup.html>pop-up menu</a>.

<h2><a name=popup>Pop-up menu</a></h2>
If you hold the <kbd>ALT</kbd> or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while you click on a link or an image,
AWeb opens a <a href=../Starting/popup.html>pop-up menu</a> with several very useful
choices that were not easily accommodated otherwise.
<p>
You can <a HREF=../Configuring/uioptions.html#popup>configure</a> AWeb to open the
popup menu also when you hold down the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key,
or when you use the middle or right mouse button.

<h2><a name=clipboard>Clipboard usage</a></h2>
The clipboard is supported in several ways.
<p>
You can copy the current URL to the clipboard, so you can easily include it
in other programs. Use the <code>Control / Copy&nbsp;URL</code> menu item.
<p>
You can also paste the clipboard contents to the URL field. Use the
<code>Control / Paste&nbsp;URL</code> menu item for this. Only the first
line of text will be pasted.
<p>
Finally, you can select text from the page and copy it to the clipboard.
Drag-select the section of text to be copied, and use the
<code>Control / Copy&nbsp;block</code> menu item. If you hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd>
key while drag-selecting, an existing selection is extended to the mouse position.
<p>
Although this is a very useful feature, sometimes it can be annoying. Like
when you click on a link, and accidentely you move the mouse a bit while the mouse
button is depressed, and your click-on-link has turned into a drag-select.
To avoid this, you can turn on or off drag-selecting in two ways. First, you
can use the <code>Control / Dragging</code> menu item to turn drag-selecting
temporarily on or off. Second, you can
<a HREF=../Configuring/proptions.html#dragging>configure</a> AWeb so that drag-selecting
is disabled (or enabled) by default. You can then always turn it on temporarily
by the <code>Control / Dragging</code> menu item.
<h2><a name=appwindow>AppWindow feature</a></h2>
If you run AWeb on the Workbench screen, the browser windows act as
<em>AppWindows</em>. This means that you can drag a Workbench icon over the
browser window, and the file associated with that icon will be opened in
that window.

<h2><a name=iconify>Iconify</a></h2>
With the <code>Project / Iconify</code> menu item, you can iconify AWeb. When
iconified, all windows and the own AWeb screen are closed, thereby freeing some
memory (especially if AWeb was run on its own screen). Also, all images are
flushed from memory. All transfers continue in the background.
<p>
After iconification, AWeb will appear as icon on the WorkBench screen. Double-click
the icon to let AWeb re-open its screen and windows. You can also drag another icon
over the AWeb icon to de-iconify AWeb and open the file associated with that icon
in a new window.
<p>
When Iconified, you can still address AWeb's <a href="../Advanced/ARexx/arexx.html">ARexx
ports</a>. Note that some ARexx commands will cause AWeb to de-iconify automatically.
