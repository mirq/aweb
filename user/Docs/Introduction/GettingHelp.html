<H1>&nbsp; Getting Help</H1>

If you are having any problems or have a question answered that can't be answered in the AWeb documentation (don't forget to try the Search feature), the best place to ask is via the AWeb mailing list.  This mailing list has been running since 1999 at Yahoo Groups and as of writing has over 300 members, so there is bound to be someone who can help!

<P>Remember, AWeb is an Open Source project developed by volunteers in their spare time.  Unfortunately this makes it impractical to provide any kind of "formal" support channel.  You may be surprised to learn developers have lives too!  Experience has shown that the majority of problems are configuration or system or otherwise user (yes, that's you) related and can be easily answered by fellow users.  The developers <I>are</I> on the mailing list though, and if you are really stuck, fear not, help is at hand.

<P>You do not need to be a member of Yahoo Groups and have a YahooID to use the AWeb mailing list, but it makes life much easier if you do, as a YahooID gives you access to the mailing list messages and settings via web interface, if you prefer that.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/awebml/" TARGET="_blank">Join the AWeb mailing list via web interface</A></FONT>  Click the "Join This Group!" button and follow the instructions.

<P>If you prefer not to use the YahooGroups web interface, you can still join the AWeb mailing list by simply sending an empty e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:awebml-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">awebml-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>

<P>All subscription requests are manually approved.  This is because Yahoo Groups is plagued by spam bots and manual approval prevents these bots from joining the list and bombarding us all with yet more rubbish.  You will not receive spam from this mailing list!  After approval, you will be sent an e-mail which explains how to use the mailing list, including how to unsubscribe should you wish to do so.

<P>
