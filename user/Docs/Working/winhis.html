<h1>&nbsp; The history window</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
In the history window, you can check all the pages you have visited
in the current AWeb session. You can select old pages to display again.
The history window offers filtering and ordering options.

<h2>Opening the window</h2>
Select <code>Navigate / Window&nbsp;history</code> from the menu to open the history
window. The display will be <a href=#filter>filtered</a> automatically
for the window in which you selected the menu item.
<p>
If the history window is already open, it will pop up to front, and
will be activated. Also, the <a href=#filter>selected window</a> will
change to the window for which you opened the history.

<h2>The history list</h2>
In the list, all visited pages are shown.
<p>
The <strong>first column</strong> contains the <em>window number</em>.
This is the same number as appears in the title bar of the window.
<p>
The <strong>second column</strong> contains the
<em>frame indicator</em> and the <em>mainline indicator</em>.<br>
The <em>frame indicator</em> is a plus sign ("+"). It indicates that the
entry in the history list was an update of a frame, not a reload in the
entire window.<br>
The <em>mainline indicator</em>
is a little arrow: <img src="Images/whismain.gif" alt="v" width=10 height=12>.
Suppose you retrieve pages <b>A</b> - <b>B</b> - <b>C</b> - <b>D</b>, then go back
to <b>C</b>, back to <b>B</b>, and then retrieve page <b>E</b>. In this case the
mainline is <b>A</b> - <b>B</b> - <b>E</b>. These are the pages that
the back and forward buttons will walk along.
<p>
The <strong>third column</strong> contains the <em>title</em> of the page, or
the URL if no title is known.
<p>
If you selected <em>natural</em> or <em>mainline</em> <a href=#order>order</a>,
the current document will be highlighted. The two fields below the list show
the title and URL for the highlighted page.

<h2>Redisplay a page</h2>
Select the page you want to see again from the list. You can click on the
entry, or use the arrow keys to move the highlight. Then click the <em>display</em>
button, or hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.
<p>
Another way to redisplay a page is to doubleclick on the entry.
<p>
If you have the <a href=../Configuring/proptions.html#hwclose>History window auto close</a>
setting selected, the window will close automatically.

<h2><a name=filter>Filtering</a></h2>
If the <em>Filter</em> checkbox is selected, the list will only show entries
for the window number selected in the <em>window</em> field.
<p>
If you deselect the <em>Filter</em> checkbox, the list will show entries for
all windows.

<h2><a name=order>Ordering</a></h2>
With the <em>Order</em> chooser, you can select how the entries in the list
should be ordered.
<dl>
<dt><strong>Natural</strong>
<dd>Natural ordering shows all displayed pages in the order you have displayed
   them. If you go back a few pages, then go to another page, the latest page
   is added at the end of the list. If you redisplay a page that was displayed before,
   it is also added again to the end of the list.
<br><br>
<dt><strong>Mainline</strong>
<dd>The list shows only the pages on the mainline. That is, entries for which the
   <em>mainline indicator</em> is off will not be shown.
<br><br>
<dt><strong>Retrieved</strong>
<dd>The list contains the pages in the order as they were retrieved for the
   first time. The list will show every page only once.
<br><br>
<dt><strong>Title</strong>
<dd>The entries in the list are sorted by their title.
<br><br>
<dt><strong>URL</strong>
<dd>The entries in the list are sorted by their URL (network address). The list
   will show URLs instead of titles if you select this ordering.
