<h1>&nbsp; Sending mail</h1>

You can use the built-in mailer to send e-mail messages. This includes full
support for <code>mailto:</code> type URLs and forms. Reading mail is
not supported.

<h2>Setup</h2>
Before you can use the built-in mailer, you have to configure it
in the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html">Mail/News</a> page of the
<a href="../Configuring/settings.html#network">network settings window</a>.

<h3>Required settings</h3>
The following fields are required:
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#email">e-mail address</a> and
<li>your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#realname">real name</a>.
<li>The <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#smtphost">SMTP mail host</a> that
   you are going to use, probably this is called "<code>mail.</code>"
   or "<code>smtp.</code>" followed by the name of your provider.
</ul>

<h3>Optional settings</h3>
The following fields are optional:
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#replyto">reply-to address</a> if
   reactions in e-mail should go to a different address.
<li>Your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#signature">signature file</a>,
   the contents of this file is appended to every mail message you send.
</ul>
<p>
Optionally, you can use an <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#extmailer">
external mailer</a> instead of the built-in one.
<p>

<h2>Writing a message</h2>
Whenever you click a <code>mailto:</code> type URL, or you submit a
"mailto-form", the <em>new mail</em> form is displayed. You can change
the addressee (although this is not recommended), change the subject,
and write your message.
<p>
If you entered the mailer to write a personal reply to a
<a href="news.html">newsgroup</a> article, the original article is quoted
(included in your article). Please spend a few seconds to cut down the
quoted text until it only contains the lines that you are actually
responding to.
<p>
You can <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#mailquote">customize</a> the quote
header that appears above the quoted text.
<p>
You can add extra message headers to your article. To do so, check the
<em>extra mail headers included</em> checkbox, and add the extra headers to
the start of the message body. You must leave a blank line after the last
header line to separate the extra headers from the message body.
