<h1>&nbsp; Network Status Window</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The Network Status Window shows all pending network and local file accesses.
There are possibilities to cancel selected transfers, or all transfers.
<h2>Opening the window</h2>
You can open the window in three ways:
<ul>
<li>By clicking the <em>network status</em> button
<li>By selecting the <code><b>Control / Network Status...</b></code> menu item
<li>By using the hotkey <b><i>A</i></b> ?
</ol>
<h2>Contents of the list</h2>
The listview contains a line for each pending or queued transfer. The
line consists of the filename retrieved (without hostname and path), and
the <em>current status</em>.
<p>
<em>Current status</em> can be one of the following:
<br><tt><b>Queued &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></tt>Image will be loaded when network slots become available
<br><tt><b>Started &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></tt>Transfer process has started
<br><tt><b>Looking up &nbsp;</b></tt>Looking up host name
<br><tt><b>Connecting &nbsp;</b></tt>Making connection
<br><tt><b>Waiting &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></tt>Request sent; waiting for response
<br><tt><b>99999/99999 </b></tt>Reading
<h2>Cancel transfers</h2>
You can cancel one or more specific transfers by first selecting the entries in the
listview, then click the <em>cancel</em> button at the bottom left. You can select
more than one entry by holding the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key while clicking on the
second and later entries. <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-clicking on a selected entry will
deselect it.
<p>
You can cancel all transfers by clicking the <em>cancel all</em> button at
the bottom right.

<h2>Transfer rate</h2>
At the bottom of the window the current transfer rate is shown, in characters
per second. The time needed to make the connection, and to wait for the response
from the server, is not included in the calculation. The figure is an average
over the last minute, but only since the moment AWeb actually receives data from the
network.
<p>
Only network transfers are included in this figure, not loading from the cache
or from local files.
