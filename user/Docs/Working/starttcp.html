<h1>&nbsp; Starting your TCP connection</h1>

Before you can access documents from the World Wide Web, you must start your
<em>TCP connection</em> with the Internet. The connection is maintained by the
TCP package you are using, also known as <em>TCP stack</em>.
<p>
You can start your TCP stack yourself before you start AWeb, or while AWeb is
running. To make life easier, you can even let AWeb start your TCP stack when
it is needed for the first time. For example, if you are browsing through local
documents, and then follow a hyperlink to some document out there on the World
Wide Web, then AWeb could start the TCP stack automatically.
<p>
To use this feature, you have to <a href=../Configuring/nwprograms.html#tcp>configure</a>
the start script (or program) for your TCP package.
<p>
If you have <a href=../Configuring/nwprograms.html#tcp>configured</a> the stop script
(or program) for your TCP stack, AWeb can terminate the TCP stack automatically
after you quit AWeb. Note that it does so only if AWeb has started the TCP stack
before, and only after asking for your permission to do so.<br>
If you started the TCP stack yourself, AWeb will not terminate it.
