<h1>&nbsp; Searching for text</h1>

<h2>The search requester</h2>
You can open the search requester by clicking the <em>search</em> button in the button
bar, or with the <code>Project / Search...</code> menu item.
<p>
For frames, the default <a href=../Starting/popup.html>popup menu</a> contains a choice
to let you open the search requester for the frame.
<p>
Note that each window or frame can have its own search requester. Each requester
will have the same window number as the browser window, and the title from the
document in which is searched.

<h2>Search for</h2>
Type the text to search for in the <b>Search for</b> field.

<h2>Ignore case</h2>
If this checkbox is selected, AWeb will search for the text disregarding
upper and lower case. If it is unchecked, upper and lower case characters
will be treated as different.

<h2>Search</h2>
The <b>Search</b> button finds the <em>next</em> occurrence of the search string in
the current document.
The found text is highlighted.
The window contents will be scrolled so that the
text found is on top of the window. Note that the document cannot scroll
beyond the last full window height, so if there is matching text in the
last part of the document it isn't scrolled to the top of the window.
<p>
You can use the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key as an alternative for the <b>Search</b> button.

<h2>From top</h2>
The <b>From top</b> button finds the <em>first</em> occurrence of the search string
in the document.

<h2>Backwards</h2>
This button finds the <em>previous</em> occurrence of the search string in the
current document.

<h2>Cancel</h2>
The <b>cancel</b> button closes the search requester.
