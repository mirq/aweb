<h1>&nbsp; User Authorization</h1>

<h2>Authorization</h2>
User Authorization is a way to protect certain documents on the net by
a user ID and password. To access such documents, you generally have to
register yourself first.<p>
Whenever you attempt to retrieve a document for which user authorization is necessary,
AWeb will pop up a requester where you can type in your user ID and
password. If these are valid, you will get the document.<p>
On subsequent accesses to documents within the same <em>realm</em> on the
same server, you don't need to enter your user ID and password again.

<h2>Save your authorization details</h2>
AWeb remembers all authorization details and saves them to disk when you quit.
The next time you start AWeb, your authorization details are read so you
won't need to enter these again.
<p>
To save these data during your session,
select the <code>Cache / Save&nbsp;authorizations</code> menu item.<br>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> the authorization file is in an internal format.
Do not attempt to modify this file.

<h2><a name=edit>Edit your authorization details</a></h2>
The <em>edit authorizations</em> requester allows you to change your user ID
and password for known authorized sites, or delete the authorization
details for a site.
<p>
You open the edit authorization requester by selecting the <code>Cache /
Edit&nbsp;authorizations...</code> menu item.
<p>
After selecting an entry from the list, you can change your user ID and
your password. Pressing the <b>Del</b> button will delete the entry.
<p>
The changes will be saved to disk when you quit AWeb, or when you save
them earlier yourself.

<h2><a name=proxy>Proxy authorization</a></h2>
Some <a href=../Configuring/nwproxy.html>proxy servers</a> need authentication.
If you use such a proxy, AWeb will pop up the same requester as for
normal user authorization, to ask for your user ID and password for that proxy.
