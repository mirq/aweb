<h1>&nbsp; Hotlist</h1>

<h2>Adding a page</h2>
The AWeb hotlist can be used to remember the addresses of interesting
pages. Whenever you find an interesting page that you think you would
like to visit again in the future, you should add the page to the hotlist.
Do this by pressing the <em>add to hotlist</em> button, or
using the <code>Hotlist / Add&nbsp;to&nbsp;hotlist</code> menu item.

<h2>Using the list</h2>
Press the <em>hotlist</em> button, or use the
<code>Hotlist / Show&nbsp;hotlist</code> menu item to load a page
with all links to all remembered pages.
<p>
With the
<a href=../Configuring/proptions.html#hlrequester>Hotlist button gives requester</a>
setting, you can make the <em>hotlist</em> button
pop up a requester. This is the same requester as for the <code>Hotlist
/ Hotlist&nbsp;Viewer...</code> menu item. The functions in this requester
are described below.

<h2><a name=viewer>Hotlist viewer</a></h2>
When you choose the <code>Hotlist / Hotlist viewer...</code> menu item,
a requester will open. In this requester you can choose entries
from a hierarchical list.
<p>
Use the window close gadget, or the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to close the
requester.

<h3>Follow a link</h3>
Select the entry for the document you want to load, either with the
mouse or with the cursor up and down keys. Now you can load the
document with either the <em>Follow</em> button or with the
<kbd>Enter</kbd> key.<br>
Another way to follow a link is to double-click on it.
<P>If you have enabled the <A HREF="../Configuring/proptions.html#hlsingleclick">Use Singleclick in Hotlist Viewer</A> setting, you only need to single-click an entry in the listview to follow the URI.
<p>
If you have selected the
<a href=../Configuring/proptions.html#hlclose>Hotlist requester auto close</a>
setting, the requester will close if you follow a link, otherwise
the requester stays open.

<h3>Show URLs</h3>
By default only the page titles are shown in the list. If you select
the <em>URLs</em> checkbox, the URLs for each page is shown too.

<h3>Managing the list</h3>
Click the <em>Manager</em> button to open the
<a href=hotlistmgr.html>hotlist manager</a> window. In this window you can
add, change or delete entries and group them into nested groups.

<h2>Save and restore</h2>
If the hotlist was changed, it will be saved automatically when you leave
AWeb. You can save it earlier with the <code>Hotlist / Save&nbsp;hotlist</code>
menu item. The hotlist is also saved after you have added a link.
<p>
Use the <code>Hotlist / Restore&nbsp;last&nbsp;saved</code> menu item to
revert the hotlist to the state it was in when it was last saved.

<h2>Using other hotlists</h2>
You can specify a different hotlist to use with the <code>HOTLIST</code>
<a href=startup.html#wb>tooltype</a> or <a href=startup.html#shell>argument</a>.
<p>
You can load another AWeb hotlist using the <code>Hotlist / Other...</code>
menu item. The hotlist will be shown as document, not in the hotlist
viewer window.
