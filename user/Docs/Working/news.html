<h1>&nbsp; Reading news</h1>

You can use the built-in newsreader to read newsgroups and post articles.
This newsreader includes full support for <code>news:</code> type URLs.

<h2>Setup</h2>
Before you can use the built-in newsreader, you have to configure it
in the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html">Mail/News</a> page of the
<a href="../Configuring/settings.html#network">network settings window</a>.

<h3>Required settings</h3>
The following fields are required:
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#email">e-mail address</a> and
<li>your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#realname">real name</a>.
<li>The <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#nntphost">NNTP news host</a> that
   you are going to use, probably this is called "<code>news.</code>"
   followed by the name of your provider.
<li>Only if the news server you use requires authorization, you have to enter
   your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#user">user name and password</a>
   for this server.
</ul>

<h3>Optional settings</h3>
The following fields are optional:
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#replyto">reply-to address</a> if
   reactions in e-mail should go to a different address.
<li>The name of the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#organization">organization</a>
   you represent when writing news articles, or just a fake name for fun.
<li>Your <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#signature">signature file</a>,
   the contents of this file is appended to every article you write.
</ul>
<p>
Optionally, you can use an <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#extnewsreader">
external newsreader</a> instead of the built-in one.
<p>
The <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#options">options</a> sub-page in the
settings window contains a few options to customize the newsreader. These
options are discussed below.

<h2><a name=main>Starting the newsreader</a></h2>
You can start the newsreader from the <code>Project / Open&nbsp;News</code>
menu item, or by entering <a href="news:"><kbd>news:</kbd></a> in the URL
field. The main news page is displayed.

<h2><a name=subscribe>Subscribing to newsgroups</a></h2>
Probably the most convenient way to read news is to <em>subscribe</em> to
one or more newsgroups. This won't cost you any money, it just means adding
a newsgroup to the list of groups you are interested in. Then you can easily
enter the group from this list.
<p>
To subscribe to a newsgroup, enter the name of the group in the field at
the bottom of the main news page and click the <b>Subscribe</b> button. Once you
are subscribed to one or more groups, these are listed on this page. If you
are online, the number of <a href=#catchup>new articles</a> in each group is
displayed.
<p>
To unsubscribe from a subscribed group, click the <b>unsubscribe</b>
link after that group.

<h2>Reading a newsgroup</h2>
To enter a newsgroup, just click on its name in the main news page. If
you like to read a group but don't want to subscribe to it, you can
enter its name in the field at the bottom of this page and click the <b>Read</b>
button.
<p>
When you enter a group, a list of articles in that group is built. You can
set a <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#maxarticles">maximum number of articles</a>
to be included in this list, or use 0 for this setting to retrieve all
<a href=#catchup>new</a> articles in the group.
<p>
If you have enabled the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#frames">split screen</a>
option, the window is split in two parts (using frames). The upper section
contains the article list, the lower part will be used to display articles.
<p>
You have the option to <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#sort">sort</a> the
list of articles on their subject. That way followups to an article appear
grouped together with the original article in the list.
<p>
To <a href=#read>read</a> an article, just click on the subject.
<p>

<h2><a name=catchup>Old and new articles</a></h2>
Generally articles remain some time on the news server, and probably you
are only interested in new articles, not the old ones you've already read.
To have old articles ignored in the future, you can <em>catch up</em> with
a newsgroup, this means
that all articles in that group are marked as being <em>old</em>. You won't
see these articles again when you enter the newsgroup again.
<p>
There are two places where you can catch up, with a slightly different
result. First, you can click the <b>Catch up</b> link for a group on the
main news page. <strong>All</strong> articles currently in that
group will be marked as <em>old</em> (in other words, there will be no new
articles left).
<p>
Secondly, you can use the <b>Catch up</b> link in the article index of
a newsgroup. This will only mark the articles listed in the index as <em>old</em>.
If you have set a <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#maxarticles">maximum
number</a> of articles, or if you have interrupted the building of the
article index, those articles not in the list are not marked. This way
you can read a group with many articles in "chunks", each time you enter
the group again after <em>catch up</em> you'll see a new bunch of articles.
<p>
You cannot undo a <em>catch up</em> operation. You can however unsubscribe
and subscribe again to a newsgroup, and all articles will be <em>new</em>
again.

<h2><a name=read>Reading articles</a></h2>
To read an article, click on its subject in the article index. The article
text will be displayed in the lower part of the window (or in the entire
window if you have disabled the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#frames">split
screen</a> option).
<p>
By default the only <em>headers</em> shown are From, Subject and Date. If you
select <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#longheaders">long headers</a>, <em>all</em>
headers are included in the display.
<p>
You can <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#propfont">choose</a> between using
a normal font or a proportional font for the article text. A normal font
might be prettier to read, but any formatting (like tables or "ASCII-art")
will be lost.
<p>
In case you want to save an article, don't use the normal <em>save source</em>
option. Because AWeb converts the article text to HTML, the saved source
will contain this HTML that the original article hadn't. Use the <b>Save
article</b> link at the bottom instead, it will save the original article text.
<p>
<a name=bynumber>
Some news readers</a> don't allow retrieval of all available articles the usual
way (by the unique article-ID). If you can't access older articles, try
selecting the <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#bynumber">Retrieve by number</a>
option. If this option is selected, articles are retrieved by their local
sequence number instead.

<h2><a name=post>Posting an article</a></h2>
To post a new article in a group, click the <b>Post new article</b> link
on the group article index. To post a follow-up (reply) to another article,
click the <b>Follow-up</b> link at the bottom of the article text.
<p>
Either way, the <em>new article form</em> is displayed. You can enter or
change the subject, add or remove newsgroup names, and write your article.
<p>
If you post a follow-up, the original article is quoted (included in your
article). Please spend a few seconds to cut down the quoted text until it
only contains the lines that you are actually responding to.
<p>
You can <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#newsquote">customize</a> the quote
header that appears above the quoted text.

<h3>Netiquette</h3>
There are a few rules ("netiquette") that you should obey when posting
to newsgroups. Nobody will stop you from breaking these rules, but you
will annoy many people if you do.
<ul>
<li>Don't change the subject for a follow-up, unless it doesn't cover
   the actual article subject any more.
<li>Don't post the same article to many newsgroups at once.
<li>Don't quote an entire article and only add 1 or 2 lines.
<li>Don't use overly large signatures (more than 3-4 lines).
</ul>

<h3><a name=privacy>Privacy aspects</a></h3>
Spammers (senders of unsollicited bulk e-mail, mostly of commercial
nature) often use software to scan articles posted in newsgroups for
e-mail addresses to which they can send their electronic ads. If you use
your real e-mail address in
an article you post, it is likely that you will receive spam mails in
the future. To protect yourself against this, you have two options:
<p>
You can configure a false or modified <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#email">
E-mail address</a>. The scanning software used by spammers will find a
false e-mail address, and their spam mail will never reach you.
Unfortunately, this has the risk that your e-mails sent with the
<a href="mail.html">internal mailer</a> will be rejected by the mail server
of the addressee. For protection against spam mails, some mail servers
check the address from which e-mail messages are sent, and ignore all mails
coming from nonexistent addresses.
<p>
A better option is to configure your real <a href="../Configuring/nwmail.html#email">
E-mail address</a> and enable the <a href="../Configuring/nwprivacy.html#spamblock">
spamblock</a> mechanism. If this option is enabled, a random string is inserted in
your e-mail address before it is included in the <code>From:</code> and
<code>Reply-to:</code> headers of articles you post. To enable human readers of
your article to e-mail you directly, a line is inserted in your article saying
that this random string should be removed before replying in e-mail.

<h2>Replying to an article</h2>
If you want to reply to an article, but feel that it isn't appropriate
for the public newsgroup, you can e-mail a reply. To do so, click the
<b>Reply in e-mail</b> link at the bottom of the article. The
<a href="mail.html">internal mailer</a> is started to allow you to write
the reply.

<h2>Searching for newsgroups</h2>
You can search for newsgroup names using the search field at the bottom
of the <a href=#main>main news page</a>. You can enter a DOS pattern to
search with pattern matching, or you can enter a simple string for a
normal search.
<p>
The first time you use this option, a list of all available newsgroups is
downloaded. This list may be very long (many thousands of newsgroups),
and can take several minutes to download. For your subsequent searches,
the already downloaded list will be used. In order to keep up to date with
the news server, AWeb will look for new groups when you use the search option,
but not more often than once a day.
<p>
The search result is limited to 200 group names. If more groups are found, you
should narrow your search.
