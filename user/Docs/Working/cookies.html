<h1>&nbsp; Cookies</h1>

<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
Most private home pages on the World Wide Web are just simple, static
pages. Some services, however, offer more complex, interactive transaction
sequences where the contents of each page retrieved is dependent on choices
you have made earlier. A shopping site would be such an example, where you
pick thinks you would like to buy, and in the end you get a list of everything
you have chosen. Or, some sites offer personalized news, and they depend on
certain personal preferences.
<p>
Before, these things weren't possible, or only with great effort. The reason
for this is, that each request for a page is independent of all previous
pages. The server has no way of telling that this request was done by you,
and thus it doesn't know the details needed to construct the personalized response.
<p>
To overcome these limitations, NetScape has developed a persistent client
state mechanism they called <em>cookies</em>.
The <a href="http://www.w3.org" TARGET="_blank">W3 Consortium</a> has adopted this mechanism
and enhanced it. You can find a full description in
<a href="http://RFC.net/rfc2109.html" TARGET="_blank">RFC 2109</a>. AWeb complies with this
definition to ensure maximum privacy and security.
<p>
With the cookie mechanism, a server essentially has a way to say to the browser
program: &quot;keep this information on your hard disk, and include it in
every future request for a page on this server.&quot;

<h2>Your privacy</h2>
Using cookies, many interesting services can be realized that otherwise
wouldn't have been possible.
<p>
Unfortunately, cookies can also be abused to track your steps on the World
Wide Web. Many pages contain a banner advert image or a counter. Many of those
images are located on the same server. They set a cookie in your browser, and every
time you visit another page with a banner or counter image that comes from their server,
<em>your</em> personal cookie is sent back to the server. Although this cookie
doesn't contain any real personal information that you haven't supplied yourself
(how could it), this practice does allow companies to
obtain a perfect picture of your websurfing habits. Fortunately, AWeb offers
facilities to protect yourself against this kind of privacy violation.

<h2>Protection levels</h2>
AWeb offers three levels of protection against cookie misuse. You can change
this level in the <a href=../Configuring/nwprivacy.html#cookie>network settings</a> window.
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
   <th align=left>Level
   <th align=left>Description
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <td nowrap>Never
   <td>AWeb will never remember a cookie, and will never send back a cookie
      to the server. This gives you maximum privacy, but it makes the use
      of personalized sites impossible.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <td nowrap>Ask before set
   <td>Every time the server asks AWeb to remember a cookie, the <a href=#alert>
      cookie alert</a> requester is shown. You can decide if you want AWeb to
      remember the cookie or not.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <td nowrap>Always (quiet)
   <td>AWeb will always accept requests to set a cookie, and will always
      send them back to the server whenever appropriate.
</table>

<h2><a name=alert>Cookie alert</a></h2>
If you have set <em>Cookie usage</em> to "Ask before set", AWeb will open a
requester every time the server wants to set a cookie. This requester contains
the following information, depending on what the server included in its request:
<table>
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Name
   <td>The name of the cookie to set.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Value
   <td>The value to remember for this cookie.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Domain
   <td>If the domain does <strong>not</strong> start with a period, this cookie
      will be sent back <em>only</em> in requests for files from this exact
      domain (server).
      <p>
      If the domain starts with a period, the cookie will be sent back in
      requests for files from all domains with a name equal to this name with one
      part prepended. For example: cookies for domain "<code>.foo.bar</code>" will
      be sent back in requests for files from "<code>zoo.foo.bar</code>",
      "<code>blah.foo.bar</code>", but not "<code>cat.mouse.foo.bar</code>"
      because this name has two parts prepended.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Path
   <td>The cookie will only be sent back in requests for files on the server
      from this path, or from subdirectories in this path.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Comment
   <td>A description of the purpose of the cookie. Not all servers supply a
      comment with their cookies yet.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Max-age
   <td>The maximum number of seconds that the cookie details should be remembered.
      After this time the cookie will be forgotten.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Expires
   <td>The date and time until the cookie details should be remembered. After this
      moment the cookie will be forgotten.
      <p>
      Cookies without <b>Max-age</b> or <b>Expires</b> are only valid during
      the current session, and are never saved to disk.
</table>
<p>
At the bottom of the requester is mentioned if this cookie will be sent back to
the server in all cases, or only over <a href="secure.html">secure connections</a>.
<p>
In this requester, you have the following options:
<table>
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Once
   <td>Accept this cookie this time only. It will be sent back in requests
      that match the domain and path. The next time the server wants to change
      the value of this cookie, AWeb will show the cookie requester again.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Accept
   <td>Accept this cookie, and all future updates of this cookie.
      "This cookie" is the cookie identified by its name, domain and path.
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Never
   <td>Do not remember this cookie, and add the domain to the
      <a href=../Configuring/nwprivacy.html#nocookie>No-cookie list</a>. Future
      attempts by this server to set a cookie will be denied automatically.<br>
<tr align=left valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Cancel
   <td>Do not remember this cookie this time.
</table>

<h2><a name=rfc2109>RFC 2109 protection</a></h2>
As mentioned above, the W3 consortium has developed an enhanced mechanism for
cookies, with better protection of your privacy. This mechanism basically
sends back the domain and path for which the cookie was originally set. This
way, the server has a possibility to check if the cookie really was set by
that server, not by some spoofing site. This enhanced mechanism was carefully
designed so that is would be compatible with the existing limited mechanism
introduced by NetScape.
<p>
Unfortunately, some servers are using cookies in such a way that the enhanced
mechanism actually produces incompatible results. If you encounter problems
like a site complaining that your browser doesn't support cookies (but you
have turned cookie usage on), try
<a href="../Configuring/nwprivacy.html#rfc2109">disabling</a> the RFC 2109 mechanism.

<h2>Cookie file</h2>
Cookies are saved in a file named <code>AWCK</code>, located in your
<A HREF="../Advanced/cache.html#cachedir">cache directory</A>. This is a readable file,
and you are allowed to edit it in order to remove cookies or change their
details.
<p>
Note that the appearance of the keyword "<code>*ACCEPT;</code>" means that
you have accepted future updates of this cookie. If you remove this keyword,
the cookie alert requester will be shown again when the server tries to
update this cookie.
